https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-banks-tumble-as-weak-economic-data-sparks-recession-fears-3555240,"By Manya Saini and Saeed Azhar (Reuters) -U.S. bank stocks slumped on Monday as fears of a recession sent investors fleeing from a sector closely tied to the health of the economy and toward safe-haven assets. The Banks Index, tracking a basket of large-cap bank stocks, was last down 2.4%, while the KBW Regional Banking Index fell 3.1%. Citigroup led big bank losses with a nearly 4% fall. JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: ) and Bank of America declined 2.2% and 2.7%, respectively. Goldman Sachs dropped 2.7%. Lenders typically feel the squeeze as recessions heighten concerns over credit losses due to higher unemployment, while loan demand - a key factor in profitability - also takes a beating. ""The economy is potentially slowing more than people appreciated, based on last week's economic data, that first and foremost is the biggest driver as it impacts loan growth, income growth, credit quality,"" said Jason Goldberg, banking analyst at Barclays. Investors have been jittery since a crisis of confidence hit the sector last year, in part due to higher interest rates, and took down three major regional players. Among regional banks, Customers Bancorp (NYSE: )'s shares fell nearly 4.6%, while Huntington Bancshares (NASDAQ: ) dropped 3.4%. ""This market volatility, coupled with potential liquidity dislocation, could pose significant challenges for banks, especially in managing funding and liquidity risks,"" said rating agency Moody's (NYSE: ) banking analyst Laurent Birade. The U.S. unemployment rate jumped to a near three-year high of 4.3% in July amid a significant slowdown in hiring, heightening fears the labor market was deteriorating and potentially making the economy vulnerable to a recession. ""It's very normal, especially with interest rates having gone up as much as they have and you're seeing that weakness in the commercial real estate market, to see credit losses normalizing,"" said Erika Najarian, analyst at UBS. ""The jobs print is essentially saying things are not as awesome as they were, they're not saying that things are terrible."" The economic weakness will likely seep into the sector's outlook after a mixed sector-quarter earnings season, where executives from top U.S. banks remained divided over the Fed's future path on interest rate cuts and flagged deterioration in consumer health. ""This may be a few-day blip. I don't think anybody's ready to call this the beginning of a several-quarter downturn in the markets or the economy,"" said Stephen Biggar, banking analyst at Argus Research. ""High rates have kind of worn out their welcome, and at this point, lower rates would stimulate loan growth, and would also take some of the pressure off the deposit costs, and at the same time, help the economy avoid a downturn or recession,"" he added. The S&P 500 Banks Index is down 9.5% month-to-date, compared with a 6.3% decline in the benchmark S&P 500. The KBW Regional Banking Index has lost about 10% over the same period."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/analysisglobal-market-rout-has-more-to-do-with-end-of-cheap-funding-than-us-economy-3555218,"By Nell Mackenzie and Yoruk Bahceli LONDON (Reuters) - A meltdown in world equity markets in recent days is more reflective of a wind-down of carry trades used by investors to juice their bets than a hard and fast shift in the U.S. economic outlook, analysts say. While Friday's weaker-than-expected U.S. jobs data was the catalyst for the market sell-off, with Japan's blue-chip index on Monday suffering its biggest one-day rout since the 1987 Black Monday selloff, the employment report alone wasn't weak enough to be the main driver of such violent moves, they added. Instead, the answer likely lies in a further sharp position unwind of carry trades, where investors have borrowed money from economies with low interest rates such as Japan or Switzerland, to fund investments in higher-yielding assets elsewhere. They have been caught out as the Japanese yen has rallied by more than 11% against the dollar from 38-year lows hit just a month ago. ""In our assessment a lot of this (market sell-off) has been down to position capitulation as a number of macro funds have been caught the wrong way around on a trade, and stops have been triggered, initially starting with FX and the Japanese yen,"" said Mark Dowding, chief investment officer at BlueBay Asset Management, referring to pre-determined levels that trigger buying or selling. ""We don't see evidence in data that's saying we're looking at a hard landing,"" he added. One Asian-based investor, who asked not to be identified, said that some of the biggest systematic hedge funds that trade in and out of stocks based on signals from algorithms, started selling equities when last week's surprise Bank of Japan rate hike sparked expectations for further tightening. While exact numbers and the specific positioning shifts underlying the moves are hard to come by, analysts suspected that crowded positions in U.S. tech stocks, funded by carry trades, explain why they are suffering the most. By 1423 GMT on Monday, the tech-heavy U.S. Nasdaq stock index was down over 8% so far in August, versus 6% for the broader S&P index. Carry trades, boosted by years of ultra-easy Japanese monetary policy, prompted a boom in cross-border yen borrowing to fund trades elsewhere, ING said. Bank for International Settlements data suggests cross-border yen borrowing has increased by $742 billion since the end of 2021, the bank noted. ""It's a yen-funded carry unwind and Japanese stock unwind,"" said Tim Graf, head of macro strategy for Europe at (NYSE: ) Global Markets. ""Our positioning metrics show investors overweight Japanese stocks. They were underweight yen. They're no longer underweight yen."" Speculators have cut bearish bets against the yen aggressively in recent weeks, bringing the net short position in the yen to $6.01 billion, its smallest since January, down from April's seven-year high of $14.526 billion, most recent weekly data from the U.S. markets regulator shows. ""You can't unwind the biggest carry trade the world has ever seen without breaking a few heads,"" said Societe Generale (OTC: )'s chief currency strategist Kit Juckes. HEDGE FUND PAIN As hedge funds typically fund their bets through borrowing, their adjustments are exacerbating market moves, some investors said. Banks give hedge funds leverage, essentially a loan to fund investing, which amplifies hedge fund returns but can also increase losses. A note sent by Goldman Sachs to clients on Friday showed that gross leverage from Goldman Sachs prime brokerage, or the total amount that hedge funds have borrowed, declined in June and July, but still sits near five-year highs. Last week marked the third consecutive week that hedge funds' bets that stocks will fall outpaced the addition of bets that they will rise, Goldman said in a separate note, saying one long position was added for every 3.3 short bets. It added on Monday that as of the Asian close, Japan-focused hedge funds were down 7.6% in the past three trading sessions. While macro funds may have been involved in currency trades relating to the yen, many stock-trading hedge funds, because of a June short selling ban in South Korea and regulatory headwinds against the same practice in China, had moved focus to Japan, investors said. Analysts added there was room for further short-term pain as positions are unwound, but the market shake-up would be limited. Traders now expect over 120 basis points of U.S. rate cuts by the end of the year, versus around 50 bps at the start of last week, and fully price in a hefty 50 bps September rate cut. Such expectations may be overdone if upcoming data suggests the U.S. economy is likely to avoid a hard landing. ""We think it's really wrong to start fundamentally reassessing your view on the outlook here. Doing so is simply fitting a narrative to match the price action,"" said BlueBay's Dowding."

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-junk-and-corporate-bond-spreads-surge-in-sign-of-market-fears-3555415,"By Matt Tracy (Reuters) - U.S. junk bond spreads over yields on risk-free Treasuries widened further on Monday, after ending last week with the biggest daily points surge since March 2023, indicating financial markets see much more risk with stocks sharply lower as investors rushed to the safety of U.S. government debt. The ICE/BofA U.S. high yield index option adjusted spread surged 37 basis points to 372 bp as of late Friday. The ICE/Bof A U.S. Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index spread posted its biggest jump since May 2023 and closed at 106 bp. Investors have increasingly turned to the safe haven of Treasuries since last week's employment reports showed job growth slowed more than expected in July and the unemployment rate increased to 4.3% from 4.1% in June. The market sell-off has erased a credit market rally through most of the year, BMO said in a Monday note. But BMO and others said they viewed the spread widening as a correction rather than an early sign of a recession. “We’re seeing a pronounced move wider in IG bond market spreads after being on very stable footing for the entire year,"" said Blair Shwedo, head of fixed income sales and trading at U.S. Bank. ""However, this spread move is not materializing in all-in corporate yields."" Mounting fears of recession have drawn calls for an emergency rate cut from the Federal Reserve. But bond market participants pointed to data on Monday that could quash these fears. For instance, the U.S. services sector rebounded from a four-year low in July while the employment rate in that sector increased for the first time in six months. Some bond investors seemed less worried about the economic data itself than about the nagging stock market sell-off. ""Is this going to be an example of where the equity market impacts the economy through a little wealth destruction?"" said Jack McIntyre, global fixed income portfolio manager at Brandywine Global, an asset manager. Analysts were mixed as to how far corporate bond spreads will widen before topping out. JPMorgan analysts, for example, now expect high-yield bond spreads to widen to 500 bp, rising 120 bp from its previous 380 bp forecast. Demand for new corporate bonds ticked down on Friday following the sell-off, resulting in a spike in concessions offered by issuers going to market. This could dissuade some borrowers from tapping the market, market participants noted, dampening August issuance volume in the near-term. ""There are some people sitting on the sidelines now who think the economy is going to shift to a recession pretty soon,"" said Jeremy Burton, high-yield bond and leveraged loan portfolio manager at asset manager PineBridge Investments. ""Some of the cuspier...issuance is going to slow down in the near-term,"" he added. Burton and others were optimistic that corporate bond market activity will pick up once spreads stabilize given attractive all-in yields. ""Yes, spreads are wider, but if you’re an issuer this is the best deal in two years,"" said U.S. Bank's Shwedo."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-doesnt-look-like-its-in-recession-feds-goolsbee-tells-cnbc-3554870,"By Lindsay (NYSE: ) Dunsmuir (Reuters) -U.S. central bank policymakers need to carefully monitor changes in the economy to avoid being too restrictive with interest rates, but there are no signs of a recession despite weaker-than-expected jobs data, Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee said on Monday. ""You only want to be that restrictive if you think there's fear of overheating,"" Goolsbee said in an interview with CNBC. ""These data, to me, do not look like overheating ... as you see jobs numbers come in weaker than expected but not looking yet like recession, I do think you want to be forward-looking at where the economy is headed for (in) making the decisions."" Goolsbee also cautioned against taking too much of a signal from a global stock market sell-off that accelerated on Monday, amid fears the U.S. central bank has waited too long to begin cutting interest rates. The aftermath of the Bank of Japan's decision last week to raise rates, as well as increasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, also contributed to the rout. ""The law doesn't say anything about the stock market; it's about the employment and it's about price stability,"" Goolsbee said, citing the Fed's dual goals set by Congress, as he noted how prone financial markets are to volatility. Nonetheless, officials need to be aware of the possibility that markets are signaling a change in the economy's direction, he said. ""If the market moves give us an indication over a long arc that we're looking at a deceleration of growth, then we should react to that,"" Goolsbee said. After he spoke, data showed activity in the vast U.S. services sector rebounded from a four-year low last month, with a measure of services employment rising for the first time since January, although the positive news barely dampened market turmoil. U.S. stocks remained sharply lower, with their recent slide accelerating after Japan's benchmark index suffered its biggest drop since 1987. U.S. indexes, though, were off their lows on Monday after the services sector data. U.S. Treasury yields, meanwhile, plunged as bond prices shot higher in a safe-haven bid. Earlier in the session, the yield on two-year notes had briefly fallen below those for 10-year notes, although that relationship has since returned to the ""inverted"" state that has prevailed for more than two years. The dollar weakened to near its lowest levels of the year against a basket of major trading partner currencies. The U.S. services data ""aligns with our view of an economy in transition rather than one on the brink of collapse,"" said Matthew Martin, a U.S. economist at Oxford Economics. ""Expectations for aggressive rate cuts in September are overdone."" INTER-MEETING CUT The Fed kept its benchmark interest rate unchanged in the current 5.25%-5.50% range last week and signaled it was on course to begin cutting rates in September, but that decision was followed by worrying signs the labor market might already have turned. The number of Americans filing new applications for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high while job gains markedly slowed in July and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. The data cast doubts on Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assertion directly after the latest policy meeting that the labor market appeared to be normalizing gradually, which would allow the central bank to take a bit more time before cutting rates to ensure inflation was fully quelled. Instead, economists and traders honed in on Powell's other comments that the Fed would respond if there was an unexpected deterioration in the labor market, a sentiment echoed repeatedly by Goolsbee on Monday. Asked about the possibility of an inter-meeting rate cut, Goolsbee said ""everything is always on the table"" from rate increases to cuts as the Fed maintains its focus on employment, inflation and financial stability. ""If the conditions collectively start coming in on the through line that there's deterioration on any of those parts, we're going to fix it,"" Goolsbee said. Investors in contracts tied to the Fed's policy rate are now pricing in an inter-meeting cut before the next policy meeting on Sept. 17-18 and maintained bets the policy rate will end 2024 in the 4.00%-4.25% range. ""The Fed's response will be determined by two factors: the extent to which downside risks to the real economy materialize, and whether the sharp sell-off in financial markets causes something to break,"" said Neil Shearing, group chief economist at Capital Economics. Powell, who has come under a renewed political lens ahead of the U.S. presidential election in November, was given short thrift by Democratic U.S. Senator Elizabeth Warren. ""He's been warned over and over again that waiting too long risks driving the economy into a ditch,"" she said in a post on X following the jobs report on Friday. ""Powell needs to cancel his summer vacation and cut rates now - not wait 6 weeks."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/are-401k-matching-contributions-all-they-are-cracked-up-to-be-3555374,"(This August 1 story has been corrected to fix the percentage of employer contributions to 40% instead of 58%, in paragraph 5) By Mark Miller (Reuters) - When you are saving for retirement in a 401(k) account, the standard advice is to put aside enough to capture your employer’s matching contribution. That makes sense, since the contribution represents a risk-free 100% return on every dollar you save. The match is intended to be an incentive that encourages saving - but recent research shows there are better ways to get people to sock away their money. In many cases, the current structure of matching programs actually contributes to pay inequity - and they are not the most powerful incentives available to employers. “When we first created an employer match, we thought that was the carrot - the incentive that would get people to participate,” said Fiona Greig, global head of investor research and policy at Vanguard and co-author of a recent research brief on matching contributions. “But now we have a much heavier hammer.” That hammer, she said, includes the rise of plan features like automatic enrollment, auto escalation of contribution rates and higher initial default contribution rates. “These are the things that, without opening your eyes or engaging in any way, cause people to participate and save more over time,” she added. Matching contributions are a big, expensive feature of the 401(k) system. Vanguard notes federal government data showing that employers contributed $212 billion to defined contribution retirement plans in 2021 - about 40% of all dollars in the accounts. Vanguard, one of the nation’s largest administrators of 401(k) plans, evaluated more than 1,300 large retirement plans that the firm administers. The research does not conclude that employers should stop matching employee contributions - far from it. But it did find that employee saving rates do not vary much across plans with different levels of employer matches. More concerning is the finding that employer contributions exacerbate pay inequity. The contributions are highly concentrated, with 44% of dollars accruing to the top 20% of earners. “Higher-income people tend to participate more, and they also tend to contribute more,” said Greig. Indeed, a study by the Center for Retirement Research found that 59% of the tax deferral feature of 401(k) plans benefited the top fifth of earners, compared with just 3.7% for the bottom 40% of earners. The upshot is that employees who do not take full advantage of their employer match effectively get paid less than their peers, who save more, for a variety of reasons. That gap spills over into a broader problem with inequity in retirement security. The U.S. has persistent disparities in savings by race and ethnicity, with Black households holding only 14% as much as white households, and Hispanic households just 20% compared with white households. NEEDED: A BROADER EQUITY MENU There are plenty of opportunities to improve the equity of retirement security in the U.S. outside of the current features of 401(k)s. I would start with an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits, with extra bumps for low- and middle-income workers who have the least ability to save for retirement. Improved access to workplace saving plans also could help greatly. Only about half of private-sector U.S. workers are covered by an employer retirement saving plan at any given time - and that figure has not budged much over the years. The lost opportunity to save at the workplace translates into far too many people retiring only on Social Security. Seventeen U.S. states have moved to plug the gap with “auto-IRA” plans that mandate employers who do not offer their own 401(k)s to enroll workers in a government-sponsored plan. Eight of those states - including California, Illinois and Maryland - have launched their savings programs, and some policymakers hope to see the idea expanded nationally. Others have advocated what amounts to a national 401(k) plan featuring a government matching contribution for anyone lacking workplace coverage. Vanguard’s brief points to opportunities to reform the matching-contribution system to make it more equitable. The most common match programs use percentages - for example, 50% of an employee's contributions up to 6% of pay. Some plans contribute regardless of what the employee does. And some have employer contributions up to a dollar cap - for example, a 10% match on 6% of pay but capped at $6,000. But the researchers found little difference in employee contribution rates across various formulas. Other 401(k) plan features do seem to be leading to improved investor behavior. Vanguard’s latest annual report on workplace plan trends found a record-high share of plans offering automatic enrollment, rising employee participation rates and record-high rates of deferral into retirement accounts. And Vanguard is not suggesting that employer matches should be retired - rather, changes should be made that could make the matches more equitable. “These are big dollars being spent, and we think there are some ways that employers can evaluate their plans to make them more equitable and cost-effective.” Plans that pair auto-enrollment with a dollar cap scored highest for equitable treatment of employees, Vanguard found. “Auto-enrollment causes everyone to benefit from the employer match, rather than leaving people to make the choice to not participate at all,” said Greig. “And that is really important in terms of equity.” The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-interest-rate-futures-price-in-intermeeting-fed-cut-3555342,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK (Reuters) - Futures on the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) and the Federal funds rate, which measure expectations of Federal Reserve monetary policy moves, on Monday priced in an inter-meeting interest rate cut. The August 2024 SOFR futures have factored in the likelihood that the Fed will cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points (bps) this month. The September futures, on the other hand, have priced in a 100% chance of at least a 50 bps rate reduction. SOFR, a measure of the cost of borrowing cash overnight, was at 5.35% as of late Friday. In fed funds futures, the market has priced in 25 bps easing in August. For 2024, futures have priced in about 122 bps of cuts, scaling down from about 140 bps in cuts seen earlier in the session, according to LSEG calculations. Expectations of an early rate cut by the Fed came after a weaker-than-expected jobs report last Friday that saw a meltdown in stocks and a plunge in U.S. Treasury yields after substantial safe-haven flows. Some market participants, however, were skeptical about a rate move before the Fed's September meeting. ""The Fed is not there to support financial market prices because people are upset with their returns. Their job is to see that markets are functioning properly,"" said Jim Caron, chief investment officer, cross-asset solutions at Morgan Stanley Investment Management. ""When we think about the Fed intervening, the main trigger point is if they believe something wasn’t functioning properly. Unless you see a liquidity market functionality crisis, I don’t see an emergency cut happening."" The next Fed meeting is on Sept. 17-18. U.S. Treasury yields were still down midday on Monday, but had risen from their lows of the day, helped by a bounce in the U.S. services sector index. U.S. services sector activity rebounded from a four-year low in July amid a bounce back in new orders and the first increase in employment in six months. The Institute for Supply Management's (ISM) non-manufacturing purchasing managers (PMI) index increased to 51.4 last month from 48.8 in June, which was the lowest since May 2020. SOFR and fed funds futures did pare back rate cut expectations after the services sector report. Also helping the slight retreat in Fed rate cut views were comments from Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, who is not a voter at this year's Federal Open Market Committee. Goolsbee on Monday cautioned against taking too much signal from a global stock market sell-off that accelerated in the wake of fears the U.S. central bank has waited too long to begin cutting interest rates. The impact of the Bank of Japan's decision last week to raise rates, as well as increasing geopolitical tensions in the Middle East, have also contributed to the bloodbath in financial markets. ""The law doesn't say anything about the stock market; it's about the employment and it's about price stability,"" Goolsbee said, citing the Fed's dual goals set by Congress, as he noted how prone financial markets are to volatility."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-expected-to-propose-barring-chinese-software-in-autonomous-vehicles-3553778,"By David Shepardson WASHINGTON (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department is expected to propose barring Chinese software in autonomous and connected vehicles in the coming weeks, according to sources briefed on the matter. The Biden administration plans to issue a proposed rule that would bar Chinese software in vehicles in the United States with Level 3 automation and above, which would have the effect of also banning testing on U.S. roads of autonomous vehicles produced by Chinese companies. The administration, in plans first reported by Reuters, will also propose barring vehicles with Chinese-developed advanced wireless communications abilities modules from U.S. roads, the sources added. Under the proposal, automakers and suppliers would need to verify that none of their connected vehicle or advanced autonomous vehicle software was developed in a ""foreign entity of concern"" like China, the sources said. The Commerce Department said last month it planned to issue proposed rules on connected vehicles in August and expected to impose limits on some software made in China and other countries deemed adversaries. Asked for a comment, a Commerce Department spokesperson said on Sunday that the department ""is concerned about the national security risks associated with connected technologies in connected vehicles."" The department's Bureau of Industry and Security will issue a proposed rule that ""will focus on specific systems of concern within the vehicle. Industry will also have a chance to review that proposed rule and submit comments."" A spokesperson for the Chinese Embassy in Washington said electric vehicles are a globalized industry. ""Only division of labor and cooperation can bring mutual benefits, and only fair competition can bring technological progress,"" the spokesperson said adding: ""China urges the U.S. to earnestly abide by market principles and international trade rules, and create a level playing field for companies from all countries. China will firmly defend its lawful rights and interests."" On Wednesday, the White House and State Department hosted a meeting with allies and industry leaders to ""jointly address the national security risks associated with connected vehicles,"" the department said. The sources said officials disclosed details of the administration's planned rule at that meeting. The meeting included officials from the United States, Australia, Canada, the European Union, Germany, India, Japan, South Korea, Spain, and the United Kingdom who ""exchanged views on the data and cybersecurity risks associated with connected vehicles and certain components."" Also known as conditional driving automation, Level 3 involves technology that allows drivers to engage in activities behind the wheel, such as watching movies or using smartphones, but only under limited conditions. In November, a group of U.S. lawmakers raised concerns about Chinese companies collecting and handling sensitive data while testing autonomous vehicles in the United States and asked questions of 10 major companies including Baidu (NASDAQ: ), Nio (NYSE: ), WeRide, Didi, Xpeng (NYSE: ), Inceptio, Pony.ai, AutoX, Deeproute.ai and Qcraft. In letters, the group said that in the 12 months ended November 2022 Chinese autonomous vehicle (AV) companies test drove more than 450,000 miles (724,205 km) in California. In July 2023, Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg said his department had national security concerns about Chinese AV companies in the United States. The administration is worried about connected vehicles using the driver monitoring system to listen in to or record conversations of occupants or take control of the vehicle itself. ""The national security risks are quite significant,"" Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo said in May. ""We decided to take action because this is really serious stuff."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ethiopia-imports-cooking-oil-after-currency-float-3555242,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia has imported 14 million litres of cooking oil to ensure sufficient supplies of the basic commodity, its trade minister said, after the country's central bank floated the national currency last week to help secure international support. The Ethiopian birr slipped against the dollar last week after the National Bank of Ethiopia adopted a market-determined foreign exchange rate to secure a new International Monetary Fund (IMF) lending programme and to make progress on a long-delayed debt restructuring. It clinched an IMF deal worth $3.4 billion and funding from other creditors including the World Bank shortly after. On Monday, the birr was down 40% against the dollar to trade at 95.69 per greenback, the country's biggest lender Commercial Bank of Ethiopia said, while at some private banks one dollar was being traded for more than 100 birr. Traders in the capital Addis Ababa said the price of cooking oil had gone up by around 25% following the central bank's move. Kassahun Gofe, Ethiopia's minister for Trade and Regional Integration, said on Sunday that businesses which increase prices on basic goods would face temporary closure or see their licenses revoked. The ministry closed more than 2,000 stores for ""unjustified price hikes and hoarding"" after the new exchange rate policy was put in place, it said on Saturday."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/markets-give-off-black-monday-vibes-as-stocks-tank-3555222,"By Amanda Cooper LONDON (Reuters) - Global markets have kicked off the week in full selloff mode, with measures of volatility shooting up by the most on record in a single day, while equity futures and cryptocurrencies plummet, reviving memories of past crises. There is no lone trigger for these moves, but data on Friday that showed the U.S. economy did not generate as many jobs as expected in July has been a major catalyst. A rise in Japanese interest rates on July 31 has made bets on a cheap yen - many of which funded purchases of assets with better returns - less profitable. The unwinding of these trades has accelerated the decline across global stocks. Tokyo's index finished Monday with a 12% loss, the largest one-day drop since the aftermath of ""Black Monday"" in October 1987, when a stock market crash stripped nearly 15% off this index and 20% off the . The excess volatility and the brutal nature of the selloff have prompted a number of comparisons with past market storms, - the 1987 Black Monday stock market crash, the global financial crisis of 2008, and the panic that the onset of COVID-19 lock-downs unleashed in 2020. A VOLATILE SITUATION The , which reflects changes in implied volatility on options on the S&P, is starting to signal distress. The index has shot up by 170% since Friday, set for its biggest one-day rise on record, after February 2018's 115% gain on the back of spiking bond rates and the threat of a surge in inflation. The measure, often referred to as ""Wall Street's fear index"", did not rise that much in a day during the March 2020 COVID crisis - when it posted several 40%-plus daily jumps - or even during the depths of the global financial crisis, when it rose 35% a few days after the U.S. government stepped in to bail out Wall Street. TAKING STOCK The S&P 500 and the are down around 3% and 3.7% in early trading, respectively. Futures on the two indices fell between 4% and 5% before the market open. Monday's drop marks a fairly hefty daily decline for the two indexes. The S&P has already lost 9% since hitting a record high on July 16, while the Nasdaq has shed 14% since its record high on July 11. On Oct. 19, 1987 - the Black Monday - the S&P lost 20% in a day, while the Nasdaq shed 11.5%. During the COVID crisis, the S&P lost 12% at one point, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq fell 12%. So the market is a long way from repeating what it has done during past bouts of turmoil. THE HEART OF THE MATTER The Japanese yen is the star of the currency markets right now. Years of rock-bottom interest rates in Japan encouraged investors to borrow in it in order to fund other positions in a multi-trillion dollar bet known as ""carry trades"". Now that Japanese rates are rising, many of those positions are getting closed, meaning that the cash the carry trades generated to buy other assets is now exiting those markets - the technology sector is one of the standout casualties, along with cryptocurrencies. The yen has its own thing going on, thanks in part to authorities in Tokyo stepping in to prop it up when it hit its weakest in 38 years in late July, at 161 to the dollar. It now trades around 142, having strengthened by over 7% in a week. It has also been a traditional safe-haven asset and strengthened around 7% on a weekly basis in both 2008 and in 1998, at the height of the Asian financial crisis. But the current move is likely more linked to an interest-rate play than down to risk appetite. The Swiss franc, a carry-trade funding currency and also a safe haven, has strengthened 4.2% since last Monday. But this kind of move is not uncommon in the currency. GOLD, OR SILVER LINING? Gold has come under pressure, even if it is perceived to be a safe haven. The price has risen by 16.5% so far this year and hit successive record highs. Typically, a lower U.S. rate environment favours gold, but intense volatility means it can get swept lower along with everything else. Back in 2020, gold had been down by 3% on multiple days, while during the financial crisis, it fell by more than 7% in October 2008, as failed bank Lehman Brothers finally imploded. Silver often moves in synch with gold, but lacks the same safe-haven appeal. It is down 5% on Monday, but, much like stocks and gold, this is a relatively modest decline compared with numerous double-digit down-days in 2020 and a near 16% fall in a single day in October 2008."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/columnhopes-for-gradual-fed-rate-cuts-were-always-misplaced-mcgeever-3555150,"By Jamie McGeever ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) - ""Up the escalator, down the elevator shaft"" is a well-worn FX market maxim describing the dollar's typical moves against the yen. The U.S. currency tends to rise steadily over time, but when it turns, it can plunge rapidly. It is equally applicable to U.S. interest rates, and describes what we may be about to witness as an unusually large wave of volatility crashes over world markets. Fed rate-hiking cycles are often conducted gradually, at former Fed Chair Alan Greenspan's famous ""measured pace"". But not easing cycles. History shows that rate cuts are often large, aggressive and reactive because policymakers are forced onto the back foot and into frantically responding to damaging forces spiraling out of control, like recession or severe financial market dislocation. Or both. Or put another way, the economy practically never enjoys the fabled ""soft landing"". Instead, it's often facing an emergency landing. And that's because lagging behind is more a feature of Fed policy than a bug. HISTORY LESSON Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said on Friday it was the central bank's job to act in a ""steady"" way. A Fed paper in May titled ""Lessons from Past Monetary Easing Cycles"" concluded that ""successful policy management appears more likely when policymakers act early, more parsimoniously, and preemptively"". But despite their best intentions, policymakers' reaction function is rarely steady. Since 1990, the central bank has raised rates 51 times and cut them 46 times. This may seem a little surprising given that inflation was below target for much of that time. But rate cuts have been more aggressive than hikes, perhaps understandably in light of the dotcom crash, global financial crisis and COVID-19 pandemic. The fed funds rate fell to virtually zero in two of these episodes, and, in one case, it stayed there for almost seven years. The policy rate has been raised by a quarter of a percentage point 40 times, and by half a percentage point or more 11 times. Until the surge in global inflation after the pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the Fed had raised rates by 75 basis points only once, in November 1994. It did so four times in the most recent hiking cycle. That compares with 28 quarter-point cuts since 1990 and 18 reductions of 50 bps or more, including seven cuts of 75 bps or more. There have only been two Fed easing cycles in the last 40 years that could be characterized as smooth and gradual: the early 1990s when most of the 525 bps of cuts were delivered in quarter-point clips, and the mid-1990s when recession was averted with only three quarter-point cuts over eight months. DESIGN FLAW In many ways, the Fed is a victim of its own strategy. It is a data-driven, consensus-driven decision-making body, so it has to see the hard economic data first before it acts. Given that it often relies on lagging indicators, it will, by definition, almost always be ""behind the curve"". Its challenge is to ensure that this lag is as short as possible. Its other option is not much better. Bob Elliott, CEO at Unlimited Funds and a former executive at Bridgewater, says the Fed's ""fundamental construct"" means it is a reactive institution with limited powers of prediction, so it is better to observe than predict. ""The alternative is to manage policy based upon predictions and trying to get ahead of the curve. Evidence suggests the Fed has little to no ability at predicting what is going to happen,"" Elliott says. Others are less charitable, however. They argue that it is absolutely the Fed's job to be proactive in calibrating policy so that it meets its twin goals of ""maximum employment and stable prices"" and ensures financial stability. ""It's dangerous to have ignored all the recession indicators, just as they did in 2008,"" says David Blanchflower, professor of economics at Dartmouth College and former Bank of England rate-setter. ""They are now playing catch up as the bad data comes in."" UNPRECEDENTED Will this time be different? When the Fed paper mentioned above was published in May, the rates market was pricing in around 125 bps of Fed easing between then and the end of 2025. But as the paper's authors noted, ""Compared to the historical record, such shallow easing after roughly a year and half from the start of easing would be unprecedented."" May seems like a long time ago. Stock prices and bond yields are tumbling rapidly now, and the volatility index - Wall Street's ""fear index"" - is at its highest-ever level except for 2008 and 2020. If history is any guide - rates were slashed to zero in those two instances - we should be looking out for that elevator shaft.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/what-is-the-sahm-rule-and-are-investors-right-to-be-worried-3555125,"Global stock markets faced an air pocket on Monday, leading investors to rely on the ""Sahm rule,"" a highly accurate recession indicator, to assess whether the U.S. economy is in recession. The Sahm rule states that a recession begins when the three-month moving average of the U.S. unemployment rate is at least half a percentage point higher than its 12-month low. This gauge, known for its simplicity and quick reflection of economic downturns, was named after economist Claudia Sahm when introduced in 2019. Friday's weaker-than-expected July jobs report officially triggered the Sahm rule, raising investor concerns that the Federal Reserve may be slow in cutting interest rates to prevent a recession. However, Sahm herself is not convinced. ""We are not in a recession now—contrary to the historical signal from the Sahm rule—but the momentum is in that direction,"" Sahm told CNBC via email on Friday. ""A recession is not inevitable and there is substantial scope to reduce interest rates."" Sahm, a former Federal Reserve economist now at New Century Advisors, pointed to U.S. consumer spending, production data, and household income as reasons to be cautious about declaring a recession inevitable. ""We are in a place where things have slowed. So, we’re not in contraction territory. That frankly is not good enough; we can do better than avoiding a recession,"" Sahm told CNBC. ""What is very worrisome, and today’s employment report underscored, is the direction of travel. The momentum is not good. We are pointed towards what would be recessionary dynamics and that should be a real wake-up call,"" Sahm said. Weighing in on the matter, analysts at Yardeni Research attribute July's labor market weakness to inclement weather, particularly noting the decline in average weekly hours. Moreover, they point out that announced layoffs dropped sharply in July to 25,900 and stress that in employment-led recessions, layoffs typically increase significantly, not decrease. The research firm concurs with Fed Chair Jerome Powell's assessment of the Sahm Rule as a ""statistical regularity."" ""Driving it in the past has been that the tightening of monetary policy did cause the jobless rate to rise slowly and then to spike when rising interest rates triggered a financial crisis that turned into a credit crunch and a recession. That sequence hasn't happened so far,” Yardeni said in a note. It reiterated the expectation that the will remain below its July 16 record high until the November election, followed by a year-end rally to new record highs. Yardeni's outlook assumes that the labor market and U.S. economy are stable, the carry trade will unravel quickly, the Magnificent-7 will continue to perform well, the stock market rally will broaden, and a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in the coming weeks could reduce tensions in the Middle East."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/south-african-banks-earnings-in-spotlight-ahead-of-first-rate-cuts-3555122,"By Nqobile Dludla JOHANNESBURG (Reuters) - South African banks report their half-year earnings from Tuesday, with the focus on whether credit impairments have peaked and on the interest rate outlook, with rates expected to fall in September for the first time since July 2020. Monetary policy has remained tight in Africa's most industrialised economy with the Central Bank holding rates at 8.25% since May 2023 after a hiking cycle from late 2021. Economists polled by Reuters predict a 25-basis-point cut in September followed by another in November. However, the lag between the first rate cut and improved performance, such as sustained loan growth, will likely mean a limited impact on the banks' 2024 earnings, Charles Russell, head of financial research at SBG Securities said in a note. It will be ""more material in 2025 and beyond, especially when combined with likely incremental politically-driven reform."" Keamogetse Konopi, equity research analyst at Citi said we would need to see a slowdown in inflation and more than 75 basis points of rate cuts for banks to feel the impact and for consumer pressures to ease. This ""would lead to lower defaults and better affordability for households but this is likely to only result in a gradual pick up in banks' appetite for extending credit to households,"" Konopi added. RETAIL GROWTH Radebe Sipamla, senior investment analyst at Mergence Investment Managers said credit growth will likely come from corporate lending with retail loan growth likely to remain tepid. Most banks are expecting growth in net interest income, although some, like Nedbank are expecting to report slower growth of below mid-single digits. Inflationary pressures, high interest rates and regular power blackouts are taking a toll on the banks' most sensitive retail and small business customers, leading to defaults. Some like Standard Bank are grappling with sovereign defaults. To weather the storm, banks have boosted their provisions for credit losses and have been conservative in lending out money. Banks' credit losses have increased after a series of interest rate hikes, with the majority of banks' credit loss ratios - a measure of bad loans as a percentage of total loans - above the top of their target ranges. Although impairments are higher than anticipated in certain portfolios for some banks including FirstRand, Absa Group and Standard Bank, overall credit performance for others is trending better into the second half. In addition to also scrutinising the impact of currency weakness on banks' Africa operations, investors ""will also get an idea of the quantum of the provision that FirstRand will be setting aside for the UK's Financial Conduct Authority investigation into the country's vehicle finance market,"" Sipamla said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/feds-goolsbee-says--central-bank-will-react-to-signs-of-weakness-in-economycnbc-3554896,"Chicago Federal Reserve President Austan Goolsbee stated on Monday that the central bank is prepared to respond to signs of economic weakness, hinting that current interest rates may be too prohibitive. When asked about whether a weakening labor market and manufacturing sector might prompt action from the Fed, Goolsbee avoided committing to a specific course but mentioned it doesn’t make sense to maintain a ""restrictive"" policy stance if the economy is softening. ""The Fed’s job is very straightforward, maximize employment, stabilize prices, and maintain financial stability. That’s what we’re going to do,"" he said during an interview on CNBC’s ""Squawk Box"" program. ""We’re forward-looking about it. So if the conditions collectively start coming in like that on the through line, there’s deterioration on any of those parts, we’re going to fix it."" The interview took place amid significant market turmoil. dropped nearly 1,300 points, or about 3%, as Treasury yields fell sharply. The dropped 3.7%, while lost 5.1%. The sell-off continued a downward trend that started on Thursday, following the Fed's decision not to lower interest rates, sparking concerns that policymakers might be falling behind as inflation declines and the economy weakens. Concerns escalated on Friday when the Labor Department reported that nonfarm payrolls grew by just 114,000, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, triggering the Sahm Rule, which signals a potential recession. However, Goolsbee does not believe a recession is imminent. ""Jobs numbers come in weaker than expected, but not looking yet like recession,"" he said. ""I do think you want to be forward-looking of where the economy is headed for making the decisions."" Goolsbee acknowledged that current Fed policy is restrictive, a stance suitable only if the economy appears to be overheating. The central bank has kept its benchmark rate between 5.25% and 5.5% since July 2023, the highest in about 23 years. ""Should we reduce restrictiveness? I’m not going to bind our hands of what should happen going forward, because we’re still going to get more information. But if we are not overheating, we should not be tightening or restrictive in real terms,"" he said. Policymakers have focused on the ""real"" Fed funds rate, which is the Fed’s benchmark rate minus the inflation rate. As inflation falls, the real rate rises unless the Fed cuts rates. The real rate is currently around 2.73%, while Fed officials believe the long-term real rate should be closer to 0.5%. Markets are now expecting aggressive easing by the Fed, starting with a 0.5 percentage point rate cut in September, which is fully priced in according to 30-day fed funds futures contracts. Traders expect the central bank to reduce the funds rate by 1.25-1.5 percentage points by the end of the year, according to the CME Group’s FedWatch Tool."

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/some-boj-policymakers-warned-of-weakyen-impact-on-household-mood-meeting-minutes-show-3553796,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) -At least two of the Bank of Japan's nine board members called for an early interest rate increase at a policy meeting in June, minutes showed on Monday, underlining the central bank's hawkish tilt that provides scope for further hikes ahead. ""Members agreed that the yen's recent falls were among factors that push up inflation, and must warrant close attention in guiding monetary policy,"" the minutes showed. The discussions underscore how yen moves and concerns over an inflation overshoot were key factors discussed at the BOJ's June meeting, and led to its decision in July to raise interest rates to levels unseen in 15 years. With the Japanese currency having sharply reversed course to hit a 7-month high on Monday, markets are focusing on BOJ Deputy Governor Shinichi Uchida's speech on Wednesday for clues on the pace of future rate hikes. ""Given how latest yen rises are reducing the risk of an inflation overshoot, we expect the BOJ to hike rates at a cycle of once every six months,"" rather than at a more frequent pace, said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. The yen's latest surge has been buoyed by weak U.S. labour data, which has stoked recession worries. The Japanese currency strengthened as much as 3.4% to 141.675 per dollar on Monday, before easing to 143.165. ROUT CLOUDS RATE OUTLOOK While the BOJ kept interest rates steady at the June meeting, some board members warned that rising import costs from a weak yen were hurting consumer sentiment and heightening the risk of an inflation overshoot, the minutes showed. One member said the BOJ must consider ""adjusting the degree of monetary easing"" to forestall future risks of an inflation overshoot, given how firms are renewing efforts to pass on increasing costs to consumers. ""Another member said the BOJ must continue to closely monitor relevant data in preparation for the next meeting in July and, if deemed appropriate, raise interest rates without delay,"" according to the minutes. The yen, which hovered around 157 to the dollar at the time of the June meeting, hit a 38-year low below 161 in July - a move that likely affected the BOJ's decision to hike short-term rates to 0.25% from 0-0.1% at the July 30-31 meeting. Following the rate hike in July, BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda did not rule out another increase this year and stressed its readiness to keep hiking borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy - seen by analysts as anywhere between 1% and 1.5%. But the latest market rout, which came days after the BOJ's rate hike decision, raises questions on whether the central bank can proceed with further raising rates. Finance Minister Shunichi Suzuki said on Monday authorities were watching market moves closely, after the plummeted in its biggest rout since 1987. Opposition party leader Kenta Izumi said in a post on X on Monday that BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda must be summoned to parliament to explain the rate decision, though it was unclear whether the government would heed to the request. Japanese manufacturers, which reaped windfall profits due to the weak yen, have set their business plans based an average assumed dollar/yen rate of 144.77 for the current fiscal year, according to the BOJ's June ""tankan"" survey. A sustained yen rise above that level may hit manufacturers' earnings and the export-reliant economy, analysts say. ""From an economist point of view, U.S. and Japan economies aren't that bad now and the fall seems to be a quick correction of stock and currency markets that had been swollen by overseas investors,"" said Saisuke Suzuki, senior economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies. ""But this could cause a so-called 'negative wealth effect' on Japan's household spending that could delay the consumption led, wage growth-driven recovery scenario by crushing retail investors' confidence,"" he said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/federal-reserve-to-cut-by-50bps-in-september-and-november-wells-fargo-3554246,"Wells Fargo analysts anticipate significant changes to the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, projecting two 50 basis points (bps) rate cuts at the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meetings on September 18 and November 7. This prediction marks a substantial shift from earlier forecasts due to emerging economic indicators, with recent data prompting worries about the economy. The bank said the FOMC has largely succeeded in its mission to return inflation to its 2% target. However, ""recent data suggest the risks to the 'full employment' part of the Fed's dual mandate are rising,"" they wrote in a note Monday, highlighting that payroll growth has decelerated, and unemployment is increasing, signaling potential labor market vulnerabilities. Currently, the stance of monetary policy is quite restrictive, notes Wells Fargo, writing: ""As measured by the real fed funds rate, the stance of monetary policy is quite restrictive at present."" The bank argues that the FOMC needs to revert to a neutral policy stance swiftly to prevent a cycle of labor market weakness leading to reduced spending and further labor market deterioration. By mid-2025, Wells Fargo forecasts that the target range for the federal funds rate will fall to 3.25-3.50%, aligning with what many observers consider a neutral rate. They anticipate a series of cuts, including a 25 bps reduction in December, followed by an additional 25 bps cuts at the January, March, and June meetings in 2025. The bank explains that the urgency for these aggressive cuts stems from the need to prevent economic downturns. ""The FOMC needs to get back to a 'neutral' stance of policy quickly or else it risks a vicious circle of labor market weakness."" With inflation nearing the target and the labor market showing signs of softness, Wells Fargo believes the FOMC will start this transition to a neutral rate as soon as possible."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/eu-should-limit-curbs-on-outbound-investment-semiconductor-group-says-3554123,"AMSTERDAM (Reuters) - Semiconductor industry group SEMI Europe called on the European Union on Monday to place as few restrictions as possible on outbound investment in foreign computer chip technology by companies based in the bloc. Proposals to screen outbound investment - European capital being invested in foreign semiconductor, AI and biotechnology companies - are being considered, though no EU decision is expected before 2025. The U.S. has issued draft rules for banning some such investments in China that could threaten U.S. national security, part of a broader push to prevent U.S. know-how from helping the Chinese to develop sophisticated technology and dominate global markets. ""European semiconductor companies must be as free as possible in their investment decisions or otherwise risk losing their agility and relevance,"" SEMI Europe said in a paper outlining its recommendations. It said policies under consideration by the EU appear to be overly broad and if adopted could force companies to disclose sensitive business information, adding that restrictions on cross-border research cooperation would be misplaced. ""We encourage the European Commission to further address these aspects and to not infringe on the ability of European multinational companies to carry out the necessary investments to sustain their operations,"" it said. SEMI Europe represents about 300 Europe-based semiconductor firms and institutions, including companies such as ASML (AS: ), ASM, Infineon (OTC: ), STMicroelectronics, NXP (NASDAQ: ), and research centres such as imec, CEA-Leti and Fraunhofer. Alongside the proposals for outbound investment screening, the EU has also been moving towards a law that screens inbound investments of foreign capital that might pose a security risk, such as purchases of European ports, nuclear plants and sensitive technologies."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/markets-are-getting-ahead-of-the-fed-bofa-3554107,"The latest jobs data has heightened fears that the US economy is facing a downturn, leading to debates among investors that the Federal Reserve may need to accelerate its rate-cutting plans in order to reignite growth. The financial markets are now expecting more than 100 basis points (bp) in rate cuts by year-end, with a substantial likelihood of a 50bp cut in September. “A rate cut in September is now a virtual lock, but we do not think the economy needs aggressive, recession-sized cuts,” Bank of America economists weighed in. They believe that the weak July employment numbers were weather-related, pointing to several signs indicators. Specifically, economists noted that the number of people employed but unable to work due to bad weather surged by 436,000 in the month, about ten times the average July figure. Moreover, hours worked by production and nonsupervisory workers decreased, and nearly all the rise in unemployment was due to temporary layoffs. ""Taken together, this suggests temporary weakness. Employment could rebound – and the unemployment rate could fall – next month,” they wrote. The two-tenths increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3% triggered the Sahm rule – an economic indicator that signals a recession when the three-month average unemployment rate rises by at least 0.5 percentage points above its low from the previous 12 months. However, the BofA economists said that US recessions typically do not occur without significant layoffs, which remain extremely low. ""We think the rise in the unemployment rate over the past year reflects high participation and immigration that have boosted labor supply. A higher unemployment rate that points to slack can get you more Fed cuts, but not large ones."" They also expressed skepticism that weak manufacturing output signals recession risk in this expansion. The ISM manufacturing index has returned to levels seen throughout much of the post-COVID period. Manufacturing has not been the primary driver of the post-pandemic recovery; instead, services output and the accompanying employment have led the way. BofA now forecasts a rate cut cycle starting in September, with 25bp cuts each quarter until reaching a terminal rate of 3.25-3.5% by mid-2026. ""Aggressive rate cuts of 50bp or more are done on an emergency basis, as are intermeeting actions. Could we get there? Sure. But we are not there yet."" That said, the data suggest a shift in risks toward increased labor market slack and downside inflation risk. If this trend continues, the Fed may need to reach a neutral rate more quickly, economists said. This could involve 25bp cuts at consecutive meetings, leading to a neutral rate by late 2025, 25bp cuts at every meeting to reach neutral by mid-2025, or several large, front-loaded cuts to achieve neutrality by early 2026."

""This is the first tranche of direct budget support from the United States in 2024. In total, Ukraine will receive $7.8 billion in direct budgetary assistance from the United States this year, which will allow us to confidently pass this financial period,"" Shmyhal said on the Telegram messaging app. The Ukrainian finance ministry, in a separate statement, said the funds would be directed towards wages for teachers, staff of the State Emergency Service and other public employees, as well as assistance for displaced persons, low-income families and people with disabilities. ""The grant will help the Government of Ukraine to reimburse priority social and humanitarian expenditures without increasing the debt burden,"" Finance Minister Serhiy Marchenko said in a statement.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/goldman-recession-risk-limited-see-three-rate-cuts-this-year-3554076,"Economists at Goldman Sachs updated their rate cut forecasts following last week's weak jobs report, but believe the recession risks for the U.S. economy are limited. The July employment report revealed significant weakness, with modest gains in both payroll and household employment and a 0.2 percentage point increase in the unemployment rate to 4.3%. However, Goldman Sachs economists cautioned against viewing the July jobs numbers as indicative of a new trend. “We had expected some technical weakness in payroll growth from the calendar configuration and the impact might have been worse than we expected, and while the Bureau of Labor Statistics said that Hurricane Beryl had 'no discernible effect,' there were signs that temporary factors weighed on the labor market,” they said in a note. The economists emphasized that inferring too much from a single jobs report is generally a mistake unless there is a major shock that changes the overall picture abruptly. They maintained their estimate of underlying trend job growth at around 150,000, which is still in line with their go-forward breakeven rate estimate, though at risk of falling below it. They also pointed out several reasons why the rise in the unemployment rate, while concerning, might be less dangerous than past increases. Over 70% of the increase in July was due to temporary layoffs, which could reverse and are not reliable recession indicators. Moreover, the low rate of permanent layoffs reduces the risk of a rapid downward spiral of income loss and reduced spending. Economists also noted that some of the increase, including in July, was due to temporary labor market frictions, such as job-finding challenges for new immigrants. The Wall Street firm remains skeptical that the labor market is at risk of rapid deterioration, citing strong job openings, continued healthy final demand growth, and the absence of a significant negative shock. While some companies report pessimistic views on consumer spending, these concerns are outweighed by the overall positive trend in corporate revenues and positive surprises in consensus forecasts. Against the current backdrop, Goldman economists have raised their 12-month recession odds by 10 percentage points to 25%, however, they “continue to see recession risk as limited,” the note states. This is largely because economists view the current data as positive overall and do not see significant major financial imbalances. Moreover, the Federal Reserve Chair Powell said last week that the central bank has 525bp of room to slash the funds “and would surely be quick to support the economy if necessary,” economists highlighted. To account for the weak employment report, Goldman Sachs adjusted their Fed forecast to include three consecutive 25bp rate cuts in September, November, and December, instead of quarterly cuts. “The premise of our forecast is that job growth will recover in August and the FOMC will judge 25bp cuts a sufficient response to any downside risks. If we are wrong and the August employment report is as weak as the July report, then a 50bp cut would be likely in September,” economists explained."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/slumping-us-futures-nikkeis-hefty-fall-bitcoin-weakness--whats-moving-markets-3554007,"Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the week with hefty losses on concerns that the U.S. economy is slowing down rapidly. Japan's Nikkei index entered bear market territory earlier in the session, and bitcoin, the world's favorite digital currency slumped as risk appetite drained away. 1. Futures slump on recession concerns U.S. stock futures fell sharply Monday, with the tech sector hit hard as a soft report ramped up concerns that the U.S. economy was heading towards recession. By 04:15 ET (08:15 GMT), the contract was 590 points, or 1.5%, lower, dropped 106 points, or 2%, and fell by 595 points, or 3.2%. The Wall Street indices suffered a brutal week last week, with the tech-heavy recording a third straight losing week and is now down more than 10% from a record set last month, in correction territory. The also posted a third straight losing week, while the , which had been outperforming, snapped a four-week win streak, falling 2%. This selling is set to continue this week as investors fretted that a worryingly weak July payrolls report indicated that the Federal Reserve has kept interest rates at elevated levels for too long, dragging the world’s largest economy into recession. ""We have increased our 12-month recession odds by 10pp to 25%,"" said analysts at Goldman Sachs in a note, though they thought the danger was limited by the sheer scope the Fed had to ease policy. Markets now price in a 78% chance the will not only cut rates in September, but ease by a full 50 basis points. Economic data due out Monday include the July , while San Francisco Fed President will be speaking at a conference after the close Monday. 2. Nikkei enters bear market territory The likely selloff on Wall Street Monday has already been reflected in sharp losses in Europe, with the pan-European benchmark index falling over 2% at the open. However, this weakness is nothing when compared with the 13% drop seen in the index in Japan earlier in the session, its worst day since the ""Black Monday"" of 1987. The index has now fallen more than 20% from the all-time high on July 11, entering bear market territory, and has erased all its gains so far this year. UBS’s Kelvin Tay warned investors about using these hefty losses to return to the Japanese market, sayings on CNBC that going into the Japanese market at this moment is akin to catching “a falling knife.” “The only reason why the Japanese market is up so strongly in the last two years is because the Japanese yen has been very, very weak. Once it reverses, you’ve got to get out right,” Tay said. The yen has strengthened sharply since the Bank of Japan raised interest rates, helped before that by government intervention, after falling to a 38-year low against the U.S. dollar in June. A stronger yen pressurizes Japanese stock markets as it erodes the competitiveness of the important export-oriented firms. 3. drops to five-month low The price of Bitcoin ( ), the world’s biggest cryptocurrency, slumped Monday, falling to a more than five-month low as growing fears of a U.S. economic slowdown battered risk appetite. At 04:15 ET, Bitcoin fell 12% to $53,008, dropping to its weakest level since late-February, largely wiping out a rally sparked by the launch of spot Bitcoin exchange-traded funds in March. Bitcoin - along with broader crypto markets - have been tracking steep losses in equity markets since Friday, as a swathe of weak economic readings from the U.S. pushed up concerns over a potential recession. Led by the drop in bitcoin as well as ether, the second most popular digital currency, Coinglass revealed over $800 million has been liquidated from the crypto space in the last 24 hours. Uncertainty over the outlook for U.S. regulation has also weighed on crypto markets, especially as recent polling data saw Democratic frontrunner Kamala Harris catching up with Republican nominee Donald Trump. 4. Mars casts its eye over Kellanova - Reuters Private packaged food giant Mars is considering a potential acquisition of smaller rival Kellanova (NYSE: ), according to a report from Reuters, released on Sunday. Such a deal could be one of the biggest in the food industry, given Kellanova has a market capitalization of about $27 billion, although such a move, if it was to occur, would likely attract antitrust scrutiny given that both firms control several major brands in the packaged foods sector. Kellanova was spun off from WK Kellogg (NYSE: ) last October, and although its shares are up over 12% so far this year they are still seen trading at a discount to peers such as Hershey (NYSE: ) and Mondelez (NASDAQ: ). Mars is one of the biggest privately-owned companies in the world, and is controlled by the Mars family. 5. Crude slumps on US slowdown fears Crude prices fell Monday, trading around eighth-month lows, on mounting concerns of an economic slowdown in the U.S., the world’s largest oil consumer. By 04:15 ET, the futures (WTI) dropped 1% to $72.81 a barrel, while the contract fell 0.8% to $76.22 a barrel. Weak U.S. economic data last week has hit sentiment in the oil markets as the prospect of a recession in the world’s largest economy bodes poorly for future demand, even as recent inventory data showed that increased travel demand during the summer season had kept fuel consumption high. This has added to disappointing growth numbers from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia and Europe, raising concerns of the future oil consumption. Both benchmarks tumbled more than 3% last week to settle at their lowest since January on Friday. Last week, both contracts marked their fourth straight week of losses, their biggest losing streaks since November. The crude markets have largely looked past heightened tensions in the Middle East, with Israel and the United States expecting a serious escalation in the region after Iran and its allies Hamas and Hezbollah pledged to retaliate against Israel for the recent killings of a couple of militant leaders. Also of interest is the incoming Tropical Storm Debby, which is expected to strengthen rapidly into a hurricane before making landfall in Florida's Gulf Coast later in the session, the U.S. National Hurricane Center said on Sunday. Oil major (NYSE: ) said on Sunday that it had removed non-essential personnel from its facilities in the Gulf of Mexico, but production had yet to be impacted."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/take-five-global-rate-cuts-were-halfway-there-3553999,"(Reuters) -Global stock markets tumbled on Monday at the start of another volatile week, as a so-far reasonably robust earnings season failed to offset fears of a U.S. recession and worries that stocks have become too pricey. Here is a look at what's big in markets in the coming week, from Lewis Krauskopf in New York, Rae Wee in Singapore, Kevin Buckland in Tokyo and Maggie Fick and Amanda Cooper in London. 1/A TIPPING POINT Around half of the world's developed-market central banks have started cutting interest rates - the Bank of England did so on Aug. 1 and the Federal Reserve is teeing up a cut for September. Global stocks, crypto and bonds have been rallying this year in giddy anticipation of central banks finally lowering interest rates, while inflation and economic growth gently tail off from their post-COVID highs. So far, so good. Recession appears unlikely. Earnings have been decent, with more beats than misses. The problem is when assets are ""priced to perfection"", it does not take much for disappointment to set in. And thin summer markets often mean more volatility. Weaker readings of U.S. business activity and employment have prompted investors to assess whether rate cuts are a reflection of an economy that is weaker than they bargained for and it is time to take some money off the table. 2/MORE EARNINGS TO MULL A U.S. corporate earnings season that has come in better than expected so far gets a fresh test in the coming week, with a number of high-profile reports due. With more than half of companies having already reported, second-quarter earnings are on pace to have climbed 12.6% from a year earlier, LSEG IBES data showed on July 31. That is better than the 10.6% increase expected for the period on July 1. So far, 78.4% of companies have topped analyst estimates for earnings, nearly the same beat rate as in the prior four quarters. While most of the megacap companies will have reported already, other important results are expected in the days ahead. Those include industrial bellwether (NYSE: ) , media and entertainment giant Walt (NYSE: ), weight-loss drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), which is at the centre of the market's artificial intelligence excitement. 3/ROCKY PATH A slew of economic releases from China will reveal how its shaky recovery is taking shape in the second half of the year and chances are, the picture still is not going to be particularly rosy. The week begins with a private-sector survey on services activity, followed by trade data on Wednesday and a reading on consumer prices to round off the week. Recent Chinese data continues to point to a gloomy outlook, and a growing sense of urgency in Beijing's efforts to shore up the economy has since been reflected in its surprise rate cuts, with investors betting on more to come. Officials will be keeping a close eye on Friday's inflation report for clues on how much more needs to be done to bolster anaemic domestic demand, especially after policymakers signalled their support for more consumer-directed stimulus measures. 4/WEIGHTY RESULTS Novo Nordisk (NYSE: ), Europe's most valuable company, releases its second-quarter results on Wednesday. The company's fortunes - and shareholder returns - have soared with the blazing success of its weight-loss drug Wegovy. Its market value has risen by $380 billion since it launched the anti-obesity injection three years ago, to $572 billion. The top questions for investors and analysts are: manufacturing capacity and supply. Novo and Eli Lilly and Co, the only other company, for now, with a rival obesity drug on the market, face the same challenge: increasing production of these medicines, which are delivered weekly in a self-injection pen. Lilly, which reports on Thursday, has quickly gained ground on Novo since launching Zepbound in December. Novo accounts for almost 4% of Europe's , so its results carry more weight for the broader index than ever. 5/CPI FLIPS RBA SCRIPT From an outside chance of a rate hike at the Reserve Bank of Australia's Aug. 5-6 policy meeting, traders switched to pricing in the risk of a rate cut by year-end instead - all because of one soft inflation reading. The dollar skidded to a three-month low and stocks surged to a record high, after core inflation unexpectedly slowed to a two-year low. This will be very welcome news at the central bank, which would have been very reluctant to raise rates already at a 12-year high amid flatlining economic growth, moribund consumer spending and a weakening labour market. Traders now put the odds of a rate cut at a coin toss for November, much sooner than the RBA's assumed timing of possible easing - around the middle of next year should inflation continue to slow as desired."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/rba-preview-rate-hike-unlikely-but-hawkish-hold-on-tap-amid-sticky-inflation-3553832,"Investing.com-- The Reserve Bank of Australia is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of a meeting on Tuesday, especially after recent inflation data showed mild cooling. But given that inflation remains well above the RBA’s 2% to 3% annual target range, the central bank is expected to provide some hawkish signals, and is likely to signal rates will remain high for longer. The RBA is likely to hold its at 4.35%. data for the second quarter rose in line with the central bank’s forecasts. But unexpectedly slowed, while inflation was also seen easing. The mildly softer inflation readings give the RBA less impetus to hike- a move that analysts were speculating over after higher inflation readings through most of the second quarter. Inflation also remained well above the RBA’s annual target range, giving the bank more cause to keep rates high for longer. RBA set for hawkish hold While the central bank is not expected to hike rates, it is still expected to put up a hawkish stance, given that Australian inflation remains relatively sticky. Governor Michele Bullock is likely to flag high-for-longer rates during her press conference after the meeting, and is also expected to provide an updated forecast for the RBA’s outlook on inflation. “We expect the Board to consider both an increase in the cash rate and ‘no change’, with the no change case to prevail,” analysts at ANZ wrote in a note. ANZ only expects the RBA to begin cutting rates by February 2025. How will the ASX 200, Australian dollar react? Any hawkish signs from the RBA are likely to further batter Australian stocks, with regional markets already nursing steep losses from a broader risk-off sentiment. The fell sharply in recent sessions after hitting record highs as recently as last week. High-for-longer interest rates bode poorly for most Australian businesses, especially given that they are already grappling with weak overseas demand. Australian bank stocks, however, may take some support from the prospect of high rates. The Australian dollar is likely to benefit from any hawkish signals, and could rebound from sharp losses in recent sessions. Soft inflation data from last week and a broader risk-off sentiment had seen the pair plummet to three-month lows in recent sessions."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/elon-musk-says-fed-foolish-not-to-have-cut-interest-rates-3553722,"(Reuters) - Billionaire Elon Musk said on Sunday the Federal Reserve needs to cut interest rates and that it was foolish for the U.S. central bank not to have done so already. Musk's comment, which was made in response to a post on the social media site X, followed a run of weak data last week that has sparked worries the Fed may have left interest rates elevated for too long, resulting in damage to the economy. Policymakers left the Fed's benchmark overnight interest rate unchanged in the 5.25%-5.50% range last week, but opened the door to a rate cut at their Sept. 17-18 meeting. Traders are betting a cut is almost certain to happen at that meeting. Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday the central bank could cut rates next month if the U.S. economy follows its expected path, putting the central bank near the end of more than a two-year battle against inflation but square in the middle of the nation's presidential election campaign."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/top-5-things-to-watch-in-markets-in-the-week-ahead-3553542,"Investing.com -- Fears over the economy are set to remain to the fore amid worries that the Federal Reserve may have left interest rates elevated for too long, allowing them to hurt growth. More high-profile earnings reports are due and oil prices look set to remain volatile amid a combination of recession fears and geopolitical risks. Here's your look at what's happening in markets for the week ahead. U.S. data, Fed speakers After Friday’s weak July report stoked fears over the prospect of a recession the economic calendar for the week ahead is considerably lighter. The Institute of Supply Management releases its on Monday which is expected to point to modest growth. Investors will get a fresh update on the state of the labor market on Thursday, with the weekly report on , which are expected to pull back just slightly from an almost one-year high. Investors will also get a chance to hear from San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin after the central bank kept rates on hold last week, but left the door open for a September rate cut. More earnings While most of the mega cap companies have already reported some high-profile earnings results are expected in the coming days. Results from industrial bellwether (NYSE: ) and media and entertainment giant Walt (NYSE: ) will give more insight into the health of manufacturing and the consumer. Also reporting are healthcare heavyweights, including weight-loss drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) and Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: ), which is at the center of the market's artificial intelligence excitement. U.S.  stocks sold off for a second day on Friday, pushing the into correction territory as indications that the economy is slowing stoked fears that the Fed has waited too long to cut rates. Adding to the downward pressure was a drop in Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ) after quarterly results and disappointing forecasts. China outlook Investors will get an update on how the economic recovery in China is shaping up in the second half of the year with a slew of economic releases this week. The week begins with a private-sector survey on , followed by on Wednesday and a reading on at the end of the week. Recent data has pointed to a gloomy outlook for the world’s number two economy, and recent surprise rate cuts have reflected a growing sense of urgency in Beijing's efforts to shore up growth. Officials will be keeping an especially close eye on Friday's inflation number for clues on how much more needs to be done to boost lackluster domestic demand. Reserve Bank of Australia decision The RBA is expected to keep interest rates on hold at its upcoming policy on Tuesday after data last month showed that core inflation unexpectedly slowed to a two-year low in the second quarter and the rate of economic growth moderated in the first quarter. Market participants will be focusing on the central banks forward guidance with markets pricing in a 70% probability of an easing in interest rates by the end of the year should inflation continue to slow. Oil prices Oil prices fell on Friday, settling at their lowest since January as weak economic data out of the U.S. and top oil importer China raised worries over the demand outlook. The soft U.S. jobs report coupled with weakening manufacturing activity in China sent prices lower on the risk that a sluggish global economic recovery would weigh on oil consumption. Oil investors are also watching the Middle East, where Lebanon's Iran-backed group Hezbollah said its conflict with Israel had entered a new phase. Meanwhile, an OPEC+ meeting last Thursday left the group's oil output policy unchanged, including a plan to start unwinding one layer of production cuts from October. --Reuters contributed to this report"
https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/us-to-continue-to-classify-vietnam-as-nonmarket-economy-country-commerce-3552556,"By David Brunnstrom and Phuong Nguyen WASHINGTON/HANOI (Reuters) -The U.S. Commerce Department announced on Friday it will continue to classify Vietnam as a non-market economy country, a decision disappointing to Hanoi, which the U.S. has been wooing in its efforts to push back against China. Vietnam has long sought an upgrade, which would have reduced the punitive anti-dumping duties levied on non-market economies marked by heavy state influence. Only 12 other economies are labeled as non-market by Washington, including China, Russia, North Korea and Azerbaijan. A change in status has been opposed by U.S. steelmakers, Gulf Coast shrimpers and honey farmers and members of the U.S. Congress representing them, but backed by retailers and some other business groups. ""Today, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its determination that Vietnam will continue to be classified as a non-market economy country for purposes of calculating U.S. antidumping duties on imports from Vietnam,"" the department said in a statement after a year-long review. ""This finding means that the methodology used in calculating U.S. antidumping duties on imports from Vietnam remains the same,"" it said. Vietnam's Ministry of Industry and Trade said upgrading Vietnam would have been an objective and fair move. ""Vietnam regrets that despite several positive improvements in the Vietnamese economy recently, the U.S. Department of Commerce still has not recognized Vietnam as a market economy country,"" it said in a statement. Vietnam has long argued it should be freed of the non-market label because of recent economic reforms, and it has said that retaining the moniker is bad for increasingly close two-way ties that Washington sees as a counterbalance to China. Opponents of an upgrade have countered that Hanoi's policy commitments have not been matched by concrete actions and it operates as a planned economy governed by the ruling Communist Party. They say Vietnam is increasingly being used as a manufacturing hub by Chinese firms to circumvent U.S. curbs on imports from China. A 284-page Commerce memo explaining the decision said it was taken despite Vietnam’s ""impressive reforms and economic growth."" BLOW TO CLOSER TIES Washington has worked hard to foster closer ties with Vietnam in the face of growing strategic competition with China and the issue of whether to upgrade Vietnam has been awkward given the approaching U.S. election in November and claims by each side that they stand for worker rights. Some analysts said before the announcement a failure to upgrade Vietnam could be negative for U.S.-Vietnam relations. ""Vietnamese leaders have seen this decision as an important benchmark in their improving relationship with the U.S. and the achievement of normalization between the two countries,"" said Edmund Malesky, a professor of political economy and director of the Duke Center for International Development. Murray Hiebert, a senior associate of the Southeast Asia Program at Washington's Center for Strategic and International Studies, called the decision ""ridiculous."" ""Vietnam's market is as free as many others not on the NME list,"" he said, adding that the decision seemed ""out of whack"" with U.S. President Joe Biden's visit to Hanoi last year, when the two sides elevated ties to a comprehensive strategic partnership. U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has also promoted Vietnam as a ""friend-shoring"" destination to shift U.S. supply chains away from China. Hosuk Lee-Makiyama, director of the Brussels-based European Centre for International Political Economy, said that even if the Biden administration were to have taken the politically risky step of upgrading Vietnam, it would have been a pyrrhic victory given that any future Trump administration was certain to reverse it. Nazak Nikakhtar, a former Commerce Department official in the Trump administration now with the Wiley Rein law firm, said the decision reflected ""ample"" evidence from industry groups ""that Vietnam’s economy has not transformed to the extent that would warrant treatment as a market economy."" ""Ignoring distortions in the economies of trading partners is unfair and prejudicial against American interests,"" she said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/boe-rate-cut-adds-to-sense-of-turnaround-in-sluggish-uk-economy-3551268,"By William Schomberg LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England's first interest rate cut in more than four years will help to foster a cautious sense of optimism about Britain's long-struggling economy, but the scale of the growth challenge facing the new government remains huge. The BoE lowered its benchmark rate to 5.0% on Thursday, from a 16-year high of 5.25%, offering a bit more relief to households and businesses who are emerging from the inflationary shocks of the COVID pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Data published a few hours before the BoE announcement showed British manufacturers enjoyed a stronger July than their peers in much of the rest of Europe and Asia. British shares ( ) - which have underperformed since the 2016 Brexit vote - added to recent gains after the BoE's rate cut, with the of medium-sized firms hitting its highest since February 2022, before following other markets and falling later in the day on worries about the U.S. economy. The lowering of Bank Rate from its 16-year high and the signs of economic recovery after a shallow recession in 2023 are helpful for new Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who has made economic growth - chiefly via reforms to boost the country's weak productivity growth - the top priority of his government. BoE Chief Economist Huw Pill, who voted to keep rates on hold, welcomed the improved outlook for the economy, even if it still represented a historically tepid pace of growth at around 1% a year between 2024 and 2026. ""That sort of rate, you know, that's better than what we've seen,"" Pill said. ""But at the same time, I think it's fair to say it's not something that we should get too complacent or enthusiastic about."" Michael Browne, chief investment officer of Martin Currie, part of asset management group Franklin Templeton, said the likelihood of further BoE rate cuts would help to foster the sense of turnaround in Britain. ""In this environment, we continue to favour the interest rate-sensitive sectors of house builders, real estate, utilities and in particular the green energy sector,"" he said. REASONS TO BE CAUTIOUS The BoE's announcement came three days after finance minister Rachel Reeves announced a big public sector pay rise in the first move of her economic policy programme that seeks to double Britain's pace of economic growth to around 2.5% a year. But there are a host of reasons for continued caution. The narrow 5-4 vote in favour of a rate cut by the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee underscored the extent of inflation risks still hanging over the economy. Governor Andrew Bailey was at pains to stress that the BoE was not at the start of a series of swift cuts to borrowing costs, saying the stronger performance of the economy in recent months could keep inflation risks on the radar. Suren Thiru, economics director at accountancy body ICAEW, said the rate cut marked a notable shift in direction but the financial reality facing households and firms had not changed. ""This is just one step back from the previous period of 14 rate hikes,"" Thiru said. Investors are fully pricing only one further cut to interest rates by the BoE later this year. At almost 6%, wage growth is running at about double the rate that would normally be consistent with the central bank's 2% inflation target. And while the BoE sharply raised its forecast for Britain's economic growth in 2024 to 1.25% from a previous 0.5%, potentially putting it ahead of France and Italy, as well as Germany - that improvement reflected the stronger start to this year rather than a rethink about the outlook. The central bank left unchanged its estimates for growth in 2025 and 2026 at 1% and 1.25%, less than half the average before the 2007-08 global financial crisis. In her response to the BoE's interest rate cut, Reeves stressed the hard road ahead, with borrowing costs still putting pressure on many households and the public finances under strain, raising the likelihood of tax increases in her first budget in October. ""That is why this government is taking the difficult decisions now to fix the foundations of our economy after years of low growth,"" she said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-barkin-tells-pbs-program-he-wont-prejudge-what-to-do-at-next-meeting-3553455,"By Michael S. Derby NEW YORK (Reuters) - Richmond Federal Reserve President Thomas Barkin said he is not ready to change his monetary policy outlook after the release of unexpectedly weak U.S. jobs data on Friday, even as Wall Street shifted toward expectations of aggressive interest rate cuts. ""The job growth was weaker than what most professional forecasters had forecast,"" Barkin said in the transcript of a TV interview with the Carolina Business Review. But even with the softer turn in July hiring data, ""I don't try to prejudge meetings,"" as he shrugged off providing guidance on rate cuts. ""We're going to get a lot of data between now and September,"" he told the PBS program. ""Two whole rounds of jobs reports, two whole rounds of inflation readings, a lot of activity metrics,"" Barkin said, adding ""we'll make the best decision we can when we get to September."" Barkin's comments were his first since the Fed decided on Wednesday to leave its benchmark interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, but open the door to a rate cut in September amid a slowdown in inflation and cooling job market. That outlook, announced after the end of a two-day policy meeting, got a huge jolt from the release of the Labor Department's monthly employment report for July, which showed a smaller-than-expected gain of 114,000 jobs and a rise in the unemployment rate to 4.3%, from the prior month's 4.1%. Many economists moved to forecast a more aggressive rate-cut path, with some eying the possibility of a half-percentage-point reduction in borrowing costs rather than a quarter-percentage-point move next month. J.P. Morgan economists wondered if the Fed would need to ease ahead of that meeting given the possibility the labor market is running into trouble faster than expected. Some even contended it was a mistake for the Fed not to cut rates at this week's meeting, which a number of analysts said was justifiable given easing inflation data. Barkin brushed off the idea the central bank had made a mistake and said ""I always assume there will be an equal amount of criticism no matter what we do. And so if we had moved at the last meeting, we would've gotten an equal amount of criticism that said we moved too quickly."" Barkin said the U.S. job market is still solid by most standards, noting the rise in the unemployment rate in July was ""pretty normal"" on a historical basis and the level of joblessness was still low. ""We've been through two years, two and a half years of very frothy labor markets,"" Barkin said, ""and so we're headed back down toward normal."" On the inflation front, Barkin said ""my gut is that it's normalizing."" He added, ""on the employment side, I think it's harder to know."""

The new forecast is still above the specific long-term inflation goal established by the central bank, of 3%. For 2025, the technical team at the central bank expects inflation at close to 3%. The team's considerations are taken into account by the bank's board of directors for its monetary policy decisions. ""In the remainder of 2024 and towards 2025, levels of economic activity could continue to recover, in an environment of external financing conditions that gradually become less tight and a less restrictive monetary policy,"" the report said. Colombia's 12-month inflation through the end of June was 7.18%. For the second quarter of 2024, the technical team forecast growth of 1.8%. The government's DANE statistics agency will publish second-quarter growth data on Aug. 15. On Wednesday, Colombia's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.75%, its sixth cut since December."

The significant decline pushed the job growth below the breakeven rate employment growth, or the pace required to ensure that the job gains keep up with the pick-up in population growth to avoid a big downtick in the unemployment rate. The Fed's seasonal adjustments aim to filter out distortions Jefferies agrees and believes that while rate cuts are likely coming in September and December, it doesn't ""think that the Fed will continue on a meeting by meeting pace of cuts thereafter,"" as there is no evidence to suggest a recession is on the horizon.

The U.S. Labor Department reported earlier on Friday that employers slowed hiring sharply in July, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%. That's above the 4.1% rate that Fed policymakers' estimate is consistent with full employment, Goolsbee said. Fed policy is restrictive and tight, he said, and he noted that inflation has come down and the labor market has cooled in the year that the Fed has kept its policy rate steady, suggesting that he remains supportive of easing policy. He declined to say when or by how much the Fed should cut rates, repeating his view that he does not want to tie his hands on policy ahead of any given Fed meeting."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/four-reasons-to-take-a-breath-after-the-us-jobs-report-3552905,"By Dan Burns (Reuters) - The disappointing U.S. employment report for July unleashed a ""Freakout Friday"" moment in financial markets and triggered a wholesale resetting of expectations for how much the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates next month. There was much to grimace about in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report card on the job market, including a jump in the unemployment rate to a post-pandemic high and the weakest pace of private-sector hiring in 16 months. That said, the report was not without its bright spots like a second straight month of hefty workforce growth and came with some fat caveats, including a big debate underway about the weather. Here are four reasons to take a breath and accept that the report may not signal the end is near. BIG BAD BERYL The BLS added a big footnote to the first page of Friday's release to say Hurricane Beryl - which slammed into Texas during the employment report survey week and left some 2.7 million homes and businesses in the Houston area without power for days - ""had no discernible effect"" on the month's data. A number of economists said: ""Whoa!"" For one thing, they said, just look at the number of people who reported not being at work due to bad weather: 436,000 nonfarm workers and 461,000 with agriculture workers included. That is not just a record for the month of July, it was more than 10 times the July average dating back to 1976 when BLS started tracking the metric. And more than 1 million others could only work part time due to the weather, also a record for the month. ""We are not sure that we absolve Beryl of any responsibility for the weakness in this data,"" Jefferies U.S. economist Thomas Simons wrote. TEMPORARY LAYOFFS The number of people who said their job loss was temporary was the highest in about three years last month and accounted for more than half of the overall increase in the number of unemployed of 352,000. If their temporary layoffs last only a few weeks or don't become permanent, economists expect most of those people will report as employed in the report for August that will come out next month. Again, Beryl may be a culprit here. ""We think some of those layoffs may have been related to Hurricane Beryl,"" Oxford Economics Lead U.S. Economist Nancy Vanden Houten wrote. CONSTRUCTION JOBS STILL HUMMING Construction work, often a leading indicator of coming shifts in the economy, especially for sectors like home building, continued growing last month at roughly the pace of the last year. The 25,000 new jobs was also somewhat above the roughly 20,000 construction jobs added on average each month of the five years prior to the pandemic, a period Fed officials often reminisce about. That could augur for a recovery in housing starts, which have been sluggish for months. PRIME-AGED PRIME TIME Economists keep close track of so-called ""prime-aged workers"" - those between 25 and 54 years old - because they account for such a big chunk of the U.S. workforce. And those prime-agers are trundling back to the labor force in sizeable numbers. The prime-aged labor force participation rate rose in July to 84%, the highest since 2001. For prime-aged men, their rate ticked up to 90% - the first nine-handle since the 2007-2009 financial crisis. And for prime-aged women, it was back to record territory. At 78.1% last month, the rate matched a record high first set in May."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/catalan-separatists-vote-on-farreaching-government-deal-3551665,"By Belén Carreño and Lorena Sopena BARCELONA (Reuters) - Grassroots members of Catalonia's separatist ERC party supported on Friday a regional government deal with Spain's ruling Socialists that could patch up Madrid's uneasy relations with the region but also impact Spain's entire fiscal system. A narrow majority of ERC members voted in favour of the agreement to name Socialist Salvador Illa as new head of the regional government, according to party sources. The northeastern region, one of Spain's wealthiest, has been governed by separatists since 2010. The peak of the independence drive came in 2017, when the Catalan government called a referendum to secede from Spain, deemed illegal by courts and resulting in a short-lived declaration of independence. The nationalist movement's influence has since ebbed, failing to garner sufficient backing to form a government in May's regional election, won by the centre-left Socialists without a working majority. The only way to avoid a repeat election lay through an agreement between the winning party and the left-wing, separatist ERC, to support Illa. After the ERC's members' approval, an investiture vote could be held as soon as next week. Under a preliminary deal agreed on Monday, Catalonia would become autonomous in collecting and managing taxes that could clash with the Spain-wide fiscal systems where poorer regions receive a portion of the more affluent regions' revenues and prompt other regions to demand similar privileges. Such a shift would still have to be approved by a highly- fragmented Spanish parliament. Much of the opposition and even some regional Socialist leaders have criticised the proposal that stipulates that Catalonia will continue to demonstrate ""solidarity"" with the rest of Spain, albeit without providing specific details. Juan Perez, a researcher at the IVIE economic think-tank, warned that this ambiguity threatens the national fiscal system's fairness where ""Madrid, Catalonia and the Balearic Islands have very wealthy taxpayers who aid other regions such as Extremadura and Castille-La Mancha"". Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez has called the deal ""a step towards federalisation"" and ""good news"" for Spain. Sanchez is no stranger to risky gambles involving Catalan separatists after granting an amnesty to their convicted leaders in exchange for crucial support of his latest term as premier last year."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/size-of-looming-fed-rate-cuts-may-hinge-on-job-market-3551437,"By Ann Saphir (Reuters) -U.S. central bankers may be having second thoughts about their decision earlier this week to hold borrowing costs steady, after a government report on Friday showed the job market slowed sharply last month. Employers added just 114,000 jobs in July, the U.S. Labor Department reported, and the unemployment rate rose to 4.3%, from 4.1% in June, marking an unexpected deterioration in a labor market that had held up surprisingly well during the Federal Reserve's aggressive rate-hike campaign in 2022 and 2023. On Wednesday, when U.S. central bankers opted to keep the central bank's policy rate in its current 5.25%-5.50% range, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said he believed the labor market was in a process of ""ongoing, gradual normalization"" that allows policymakers to wait a little longer to be sure inflation is beaten before cutting rates. ""If Powell knew then what he knows now, he probably would have cut rates,"" said Brian Jacobsen, chief economist at Annex Wealth Management. ""By keeping rates on hold while inflation fell, they've applied too much pressure on the brakes."" The data prompted traders to pile into bets that the Fed will deliver a half-percentage-point rate cut at its Sept. 17-18 meeting, and drive borrowing costs down further from there, with the policy rate expected to end 2024 in the 4.00%-4.25% range. Analysts at many Wall Street banks tore up their forecasts and wrote new ones. Goldman Sachs, for example, now sees a steady every-meeting series of Fed rate cuts and Citi called for half-percentage-point cuts in both September and December. JP Morgan said there was a strong case for a cut even before the Fed's next meeting. ""I would not like to see material further cooling in the labor market,"" Powell told reporters on Wednesday. ""If we see something that looks like a more significant downturn, that would be something that we would ... have the intention of responding to."" Before the release of Friday's employment report, rate futures had been priced for quarter-percentage-point rate cuts starting in September. ""This week's Fed inaction was a mistake; the case for 50 basis points in September is strong,"" Ian Shepherdson, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote. ""July's poor employment report leaves the Fed looking woefully behind the curve."" Speaking after the jobs data was released, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said the central bank should not overreact to a single month of data, but also repeated his warning that leaving the policy rate where it is even as inflation falls means making an already restrictive policy even more so. ""Our absolute goal now is we want to settle at something like full employment, not blow through normal and deteriorate,"" he told Bloomberg TV. SAHM RULE Analysts noted that some of the underlying data was not as weak as the headline numbers suggested. Workforce growth was substantial, with the labor force participation rate ticking up to 62.7% from 62.6%, and participation among prime-age workers hitting 84%, its highest level in more than 20 years. And while the Bureau of Labor Statistics said there was no impact on the data from Hurricane Beryl, many were skeptical, noting that the number of people who reported they were unable to work due to weather rose to a July record of 436,000. That, along with the fact that fewer businesses than usual responded to the monthly jobs survey, raises the likelihood that some of the weakness will be revised away in future reports, analysts said. The rise in the jobless rate last month triggered the so-called Sahm rule, a historically accurate early indicator of recession that says such a downturn is underway when the three-month moving average of the unemployment rate rises half a percentage point above its low from the previous 12 months. Claudia Sahm, an economist who worked at the Fed, has cautioned against taking too much of a signal from her rule, given the labor market disruptions of the COVID-19 pandemic. Powell this week called it a ""statistical regularity"" that did not mean a recession ""must happen."" Even so, the increase has ignited concern that the Fed may have waited too long to cut rates, and will need to play catch-up with large cuts in borrowing costs to cushion the economy. In June, U.S. central bank policymakers in their quarterly projections anticipated only one cut this year, and saw the unemployment rate ending the year at 4%. With the jobless rate now well above that, ""the soft landing in the U.S. labor market is in danger,"" wrote Nick Bunker, director of North American economic research at Indeed Hiring Lab, referring to a scenario in which inflation is tamed without a painful recession or sharp rise in unemployment. Powell on Wednesday said policymakers were not currently considering a half-percentage-point cut in September. ""What we think we're seeing is a normalizing labor market and we're watching carefully to see if it turns out to be more,"" he said, adding that the Fed was ""well-positioned to respond"" if it started seeing signs that there was something more going on."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-barkin-says-slowing-pace-of-jobs-reasonable-in-pushback-against-big-cuts-3552785,"Investing.com -- Richmond Federal Reserve president Tom Barkin said Friday that the July jobs report showing a significant slowdown in job gains was ""reasonable,"" and downplayed calls for the Fed to deliver aggressive rate cuts at upcoming meetings. The July official jobs report showed that fewer jobs were created last month than expected, with rising 114,000 last month, the lowest since January 2021, and down from a revised 179,000 in June. Economists had seen the July number at 177,000. The also rose to 4.3%, up from 4.1%  in June, marking the fourth-straight uptick. While the month-on-month average hourly wage growth came in at 0.2%, a drop from 0.3% the previous month. ""More significant reductions typically would be associated with an economy that feels like it’s deteriorating rapidly. And again, 114,000 jobs, while not as good as we’ve been running, on a long-term basis, is a reasonable number,"" Barkin said Friday in a interview with the New York Time's Jeanna Smialek. The data prompted Citi to change its forecast for rate cuts, now expecting the Fed to deliver three cuts this year. ""Following this report we think the Fed will cut at least three times in 2024 – September, November and December – in a more front-loaded effort to secure the soft landing. Further we think there is now a realistic possibility that the first move will be a 50bp cut in September,"" Citi said. The Richmond Fed president didn't endorse the idea of more aggressive cuts, saying voting Fed members will likely look to the August jobs numbers for more evidence on the pace of slowing in the labor market."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/italy-has-no-plans-for-new-tax-on-company-profits-sources-say-3552765,"ROME (Reuters) - Italy has no plans to introduce new windfall taxes on company profits, government sources said on Friday, denying press reports. Some Italian newspapers reported this week that the government was discussing new taxes on banks, insurers, energy companies and luxury goods firms. Rumours began to spread after Economy Minister Giancarlo Giorgetti last month hinted at possible measures on the insurance sector, urging companies that have reported healthy profits to reflect on a recent rise in insurance premiums. Political sources said, however, that Giorgetti would be in favour of cooperation agreements with banks and insurers to reinvest some of their profits in initiatives aimed at helping consumers. A year ago Italy's conservative government sparked a major sell-off in banking shares by announcing a surprise 40% windfall tax on bank profits driven by higher interest rates. The government later backtracked and gave lenders the option of increasing reserve buffers instead of paying the levy - resulting in virtually no money being raised from the windfall tax.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/citi-now-expects-the-fed-to-cut-125bps-by-the-end-of-year-3552671,"Citi adjusted its forecast for the Federal Reserve's monetary policy following the release of the July jobs report, which indicated a slower-than-expected growth in employment. ""We now pencil in 50bp rate cuts in September and November, with 25bp cuts at consecutive meetings thereafter to reach a terminal rate of 3-3.25% by mid-2025 (25bp more of cumulative cuts than we had previously),"" Citi economists wrote in a note Friday. The U.S. economy added 114,000 jobs in July, falling short of the anticipated 175,000 jobs and Citi's own estimate of 150,000. The increase in private employment accounted for 97,000 jobs, with government employment contributing an additional 17,000 positions. Citi's analysis of the employment data suggests that the labor market may be entering a phase of more pronounced weakening. With the recent uptick in unemployment and a discernible slowdown in job creation, Citi anticipates the Fed may start implementing larger rate cuts. The current policy rates, considered to be in restrictive territory, along with Fed officials' growing attention to employment, support Citi's revised expectations. Other major Wall Street research players are also changing their Fed forecast models, with Evercore ISI calling for ""at least three Fed cuts in 2024."" ""Following this report we think the Fed will cut at least three times in 2024 – September, November and December – in a more front-loaded effort to secure the soft landing. Further we think there is now a realistic possibility that the first move will be a 50bp cut in September,"" they said. ""A 50 in September would become the base case if subsequent data confirms and extends a more marked weakening in the labor market, with a further increase in unemployment and payrolls sub 100,000 in August, JOLTS weakening and layoffs / initial claims moving up."" Major US indices fell sharply on today's data with both the and index down by more than 2%."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/wall-street-strategists-rush-to-adjust-fed-calls-after-a-weak-jobs-report-3552611,"The latest Non-Farm Payrolls (NFP) report revealed a gain of 114,000 jobs in the past month, falling short of economists' expectations and sending stocks lower. The figure indicates a slowdown in job creation compared to previous months, raising concerns about the strength of the labor market. Additionally, the unemployment rate ticked up to 4.3%, marking an increase that suggests a cooling job market. The combination of fewer jobs added, and a rising unemployment rate has sparked worries about potential economic deceleration. In response to the disappointing NFP numbers, stock markets experienced a notable decline, with the Nasdaq down more than 3%, the declining over 2%, and the Dow down around 1.5% at the time of writing. Investors reacted swiftly to the weaker-than-expected employment data, fearing it could signal broader economic challenges ahead. The drop in stock prices reflects heightened anxiety about the future pace of economic growth. What analysts are saying after NFP BofA: Bank of America said in its note reacting to the report that the “softer-than-expected July employment report on the heels of other soft data like the ISM manufacturing report helps to lock-in a rate cut in September.” “That said, we continue to project a gradual pace of easing,” they added. “In making this change, we also reduce our outlook for the terminal rate in the upcoming normalization cycle. We reduce it by 25bp to 3.25-3.5%. If the economy is cooling faster than we or the Fed anticipated, then it would point to a lower need for a higher-for-longer policy stance.” Evercore ISI: Evercore said the NFP number came in significantly weaker than it had expected. “The labor data is now in the driving seat,” said the firm. “Following this report we think the Fed will cut at least three times in 2024 – September, November and December – in a more front-loaded effort to secure the soft landing.” Furthermore, they think it is now realistic to expect the first move to be a 50bp cut in September. “We reiterate [that] if the Fed ever did see evidence that the labor market is cracking, it would go fast and hard, cutting by 200-250bp by year-end,” they concluded. Jefferies: The firm said the data gives the Fed an opening to cut in September. “We are adjusting our call to reflect a 25 bp cut in September and another one following in December. Past that, we think the Fed has to slide into ‘wait and see’ mode,” said Jefferies. The firm continues to believe that pricing in more than two cuts before December 2024 and more than four total cuts before December 2025 is a bet on a recession, and they “do not think that there's any evidence that a recession is imminent.” Piper Sandler: “To us, this suggests that we’ve hit the mark where lower rates no longer a bullish catalyst for stocks,” said analysts at Piper Sandler. “We expect that we will see a positive correlation between interest rates and stock prices going forward.” BMO Capital: BMO highlighted that following the data, “the Sahm Rule Recession Indicator breached the 0.50 threshold that has historically signaled the US economy is in the early stages of a recession.” “We're cognizant that there is plenty of data yet to come between now and the September 18th meeting -- although if this trend in employment accelerates in August, the argument for a 50 bp cut becomes more compelling.” said BMO, adding that they are still in the 25 bp camp at the moment."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/explainercharting-the-feds-economic-data-flow-3552323,"(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve held its benchmark overnight interest rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range at the conclusion of its July 30-31 policy meeting, but also signaled that rate cuts may begin as soon as the U.S. central bank's meeting in September. The decision will hinge on data between now and then. Among the key statistics the U.S. central bank is watching: EMPLOYMENT (Released Aug 2; next release Sept. 6): U.S. firms added an underwhelming 114,000 jobs in July, and revisions to the prior two months knocked 29,000 positions from the previously estimated number of payroll jobs. That pushed the three-month average total payroll growth down to 170,000, below the level typical before the COVID-19 pandemic. The unemployment rate also rose to 4.3%, which could heighten fears that the labor market is deteriorating and potentially making the economy vulnerable to a recession. The number of people in a job or looking for work grew. Government data in late July showed the slowing of the labor market is being driven by low hiring, rather than layoffs, with hires dropping to a four-year low in June. Average hourly wages rose 3.6% in July compared to a year ago, versus a 3.8% annual increase in June. The Fed generally considers wage growth in the range of 3.0%-3.5% as consistent with its 2% inflation target. JOB OPENINGS (Released July 30; next release Sept. 4): In a sign of the job market's continued resilience, the level of job openings remained above 8 million in June, while the number of open jobs available for each unemployed person fell slightly to 1.2, remaining roughly where it was in the years before the pandemic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has kept a close eye on the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for information on the imbalance between labor supply and demand, and the pandemic-era jump to more than 2 to 1 in the number of open jobs for each available worker was emblematic of the time. Things have cooled substantially. Other aspects of the survey, like the quits rate, now down to 2.1, have edged back to pre-pandemic levels in what Fed officials view as an emerging balance between the supply and demand for workers. While the hiring rate has slowed, for example, the layoff rate has remained stable in a sign of companies holding on to workers. INFLATION (PCE released July 26; next release CPI Aug. 14): The personal consumption expenditures price index, used by the Fed to set its 2% inflation target, shows inflation slowly subsiding. It fell in June to a 2.5% annual rate, from 2.6% in the prior month. Core PCE prices, stripped of volatile food and energy costs, remained unchanged in June at 2.6%. Despite that reading, the data looks set to help Fed officials build more confidence that inflation is moving toward the U.S. central bank's 2% target. On a month-to-month basis, the PCE index rose 0.1% while core PCE prices edged up 0.2%. Officials have begun to pay closer attention to signs of weakening demand in the economy as a precursor to a slowed pace of price increases. The separate consumer price index fell in June by 0.1%, with drops in both volatile energy items and core consumer goods like vehicles, and weakness in housing costs that Fed officials have long been waiting to see. The 0.2% rise in shelter prices was the slowest since August of 2021, and overall it was the weakest CPI print since May of 2020. The data pushed the annual rise in consumer prices down to 3% from 3.3% in the prior month, with the more volatile core index, excluding food and energy, falling to 3.3% from 3.4%."
https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/libyas-70-billion-wealth-fund-sees-thaw-in-un-asset-freeze-by-yearend-3552572,"By Libby George and Marc Jones LONDON (Reuters) - The Libyan Investment Authority is expecting U.N. sign-off by the end of the year to actively manage its $70 billion in assets for the first time in more than a decade, its chief executive told Reuters. The LIA, set up under Muammar Gaddafi in 2006 to manage the country's oil wealth, has been under a United Nations asset freeze since the 2011 revolution that toppled Gaddafi. This means that in order for Africa's largest sovereign wealth fund to make new investments, or even move cash from negative interest rate accounts, where they have been losing money, the LIA needs UN Security Council sign-off. Chief Executive Ali Mahmoud Mohamed said the authority is confident the council will provide the landmark approval by November or December for an investment plan it submitted in March. ""We believe our investment plan with be accepted ... we don't think they will refuse it,"" Mohamed told Reuters via a translator. The first of LIA's four-part plan is the ""very simple"" step of reinvesting money that has built up during the freeze, such as payouts from bond holdings. The LIA has previously tried to actively manage its funds. But in the turmoil following Gaddafi's ouster, it at one point had dueling chairmen, backed by different factions within the country. A British court ruled in 2020 in Mohamed's favor. In 2020, the LIA said a Deloitte audit showed the freeze had cost it some $4.1 billion in potential equity returns. He said transparency has since improved; the LIA released audited financial statements in 2021, covering 2019. It aims to publish the 2020 numbers in the coming months and provide them annually from next year. And while the LIA was 98th out of 100 sovereign funds in a 2020 ranking of sustainability and governance by Global SWF, an industry data specialist, it stood at 51st this year. Of its estimated $70 billion in assets, the fund has $29 billion in global real estate, $23 billion in deposits invested in Europe and Bahrain and $8 billion in equities spread over more than 300 companies around the world. It also has roughly $2 billion worth of matured bonds. The UN Security Council Committee was not immediately available to comment. Last year, after meeting with the LIA, its members ""noted the progress made on the implementation of the LIA's Transformation Strategy"" and stressed ""the importance of guaranteeing the frozen funds for the benefit of the Libyan people."" Mohamed said that it is also planning to request approval this year for two further investment plan ""pillars"" - one that covers its share portfolio and another that relates to domestic investment plan. The LIA is targeting domestic investments in solar power and helping increase oil exports. Libya is one of Africa's largest oil exporters, pumping roughly 1.2 million barrels per day. If the UN does not approve its investment proposals, Mohamed said ""we will keep trying...we will keep asking and requesting."""

Intel Corporation (NASDAQ: ) crashed 27% following the market open on Friday. The company said it was suspending its dividend starting in Q4. Intel Q2 adjusted earnings of $0.02 on revenue of $12.83B, missing Wall Street estimates of $0.10 and $12.93B, respectively. The miss on the top and bottom lines comes as margins were hurt by the ""accelerated ramp of our AI PC product, higher than typical charges related to non-core businesses and the impact from unused capacity,"" the company said. Gross margin fell 0.4% to 35.4%. Looking ahead to Q3, the company guided for an adjusted loss of $0.03 on revenue in a range of $12.5B to $13.5B, confounding analyst estimates for adjusted EPS of $0.31 on revenue of $14.39B. Intel forecast margin in Q3 falling to 34.5% even as it detailed cost-cutting plans including a more than 15% headcount reduction, to resize and refocus. ""Falling share, margin issues, and capex/opex cuts smell more like a spiral as time running out on a solution,"" Jefferies analysts commented in a post-earnings note. ""This is yet another major reset of the story with Client and Servers both well below seasonal and gross margins significantly lower,"" they added, maintaining a Hold rating on the stock and trimming the price target from $34 to $28. Separately, analysts at Raymond James downgraded Intel stock to Market Perform after the report. ""We expected the 3Q outlook to be weak but are surprised by the magnitude, especially on margins,"" they said. ""While management sounded confident about longer-term targets, GM headwinds are expected to persist through 2025, and we see limited incremental revenue drivers near-term,"" Raymond James added in its note. ""As such, we expect profitability to remain under pressure and are moving to the sidelines despite the attractive valuation and our view that an eventual Foundry separation could unlock significant value.""

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/instant-view-soft-us-payrolls-number-opens-door-to-september-fed-cut-3552269,"(Reuters) - U.S. job growth slowed more than expected in July, while the unemployment rate increased to 4.3%, which could heighten fears that the labor market is deteriorating and potentially making the economy vulnerable to a recession. Nonfarm payrolls increased by 114,000 jobs last month after rising by a downwardly revised 179,000 in June, the Labor said on Friday. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast payrolls advancing by 175,000 jobs after a previously reported 206,000 gain in June. Hurricane Beryl, which knocked out power in Texas and slammed parts of Louisiana during the payrolls survey week, likely contributed to the below-expectations payrolls gain. Traders bet that the Federal Reserve will start easing policy in September with a big half-percentage-point interest rate cut, versus what was seen before the report as a 70% chance of a more usual quarter-point cut. MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: E-minis extended losses and were down 1.69%BONDS: The yield on benchmark U.S. 10-year notes tumbled to 3.835%, the two-year note yield fell to 3.945% FOREX: The extended a loss to -0.7% COMMENTS: MARC OSTWALD, CHIEF ECONOMIST AND GLOBAL STRATEGIST, ADM INVESTOR SERVICES INTERNATIONAL, LONDON ""It was a weak reading. There wasn't really an impact from Hurricane Beryl. You had nice increases in manufacturing, construction and retail and indeed leisure and hospitality - all of which should have been hit if it had. So you can't explain the weak reading with that. The unemployment rate rose, more due to migration than anything else because labor force participation increased, You've got two forces, one of labor demand easing, not falling off a cliff but definitely easing - and a larger labor force."" ""I wouldn't say the Fed's behind the curve - you can't fine tune these things. But this essentially cements a rate cut in September, whatever we get from July CPI."" ""The last thing the stock market needs right now is another definitive signal that the economy is slowing. It's good news for bonds and credit, but not for equities although there are some other factors going on there."" STUART COLE, CHIEF MACRO ECONOMIST, EQUITI CAPITAL, LONDON ""A soft number, which must leave a September cut from the Fed starting to look like a nailed-on certainty. A big miss on the headline number, a sizeable downwards revision to last month’s print, and a 2% rise in the rate of unemployment – it is no surprise that Powell has recently been highlighting concerns among some FOMC members about the dangers of delaying for too long a cut in interest rates, and then going too timidly thereafter."" ""And what is potentially even more worrying for the Fed is that, whereas in the past a softer data would see equities rally on the expectation that inflation was coming down and interest rate cuts were on the horizon, the fact that equities have reacted negatively to today’s number suggests the thinking is that the Fed is already behind the curve and should have been cutting rates already. The two CPI reports to be released between now and the September Fed meeting probably now have to be pretty shocking if the Fed is going to defer cutting rates again."" MELISSA BROWN, MANAGING DIRECTOR, APPLIED RESEARCH, SIMCORP, NEW YORK ""The top line number is a little shocking relative to expectations. It's much lower than expected. But it's a positive number. It's not the lowest we've seen. The job gains could be low enough to trigger the Fed to act at the next meeting but they're not so low that the signs are flashing recession."" ""The unemployment number is higher than expected and higher than its been for a while. That's a bit of a concern but it's still relatively low."" ""There's still a lot of data to come out between now and the next meeting. A 50 basis-point cut is possible but given the Fed's caution, not that likely. It'll really depend on the data over the next few weeks."" ""Hourly earnings was slightly below. What that means is the next inflation report will be quite important, where general inflation stands versus earnings gains,"" ""To me it's a little surprising the market is reacting so badly because at the same time the likelihood of a bigger rate cut has gone up and the market tends to like that."" WASIF LATIF, PRESIDENT AND CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, SARMAYA PARTNERS, PRINCETON, NEW JERSEY “This is what a growth scare looks like. The market is now realizing that the economy is indeed slowing. Unemployment is an auto-correlation number. So once it starts moving in a certain direction, it generally continues to moving that direction for some successive data points. I think the market is also quickly realizing the Fed may have made a mistake by not cutting. Historically, the Fed has been that they have tended to wait longer and end up pushing the economy into a slower zone. Obviously, they've been data dependent. But now that the data's out, they will probably do what they need to do in September. But September is a lifetime away right now for the market, which is panicking.” “You would expect bonds to rally in this environment because of the economic slowdown, the flight to quality etc. But you're also seeing gold hitting all-time highs the because now we're at a point where the market is pricing in greater Fed cuts and I think the gold price is saying that's all well and good.” BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN “If Powell knew then what he knows now, he probably would have cut rates. By keeping rates on hold while inflation fell, they’ve applied too much pressure on the brakes.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/no-room-for-russia-to-cut-rates-this-year-as-inflation-climbs-economy-overheats-reuters-poll-3552325,"By Alexander Marrow (Reuters) - Russia's central bank has no room to lower rates from 18% this year, a Reuters poll showed on Friday, with analysts forecasting inflation above the bank's 4% target in an overheating economy propelled by military production and consumer spending. Russia's economic growth relies heavily on large-scale government spending on arms production as Moscow funds its war in Ukraine, contributing to soaring real wages in a tight labour market with unemployment at a record low. The consensus forecast of 14 analysts polled by Reuters in late July and early August suggested the Bank of Russia's key rate would end the year at 18%, up from 17.75% in the previous poll. The central bank warned of economic overheating as it hiked rates to 18% last week, vowing to bring down stubborn inflation, currently running at about 9%. Mikhail Vasilyev, chief analyst at Sovcombank, was one of four economists expecting tighter monetary policy by year-end, predicting another hike, in September or October, to 20%. ""We believe that the opportunity for a key rate cut will open up only in mid-2025, when inflation will steadily slow towards the 4% target,"" Vasilyev said. Analysts forecast year-end inflation sharply higher at 6.9%, up from 6.4% in last month's poll. That would follow annual inflation of 7.4% in 2023 and 11.9% in 2022. Expectations for Russia's 2024 gross domestic product growth were also markedly raised to 3.6% from 3.1% in the previous poll, as Russian government and consumer spending remains strong. GDP grew 4.7% in the first half of the year, the economy ministry estimated this week. The rouble, currently buttressed by capital controls, state foreign currency interventions, high rouble interest rates and oil prices, is seen weakening to 96.1 to the dollar over the next year, slightly stronger than in the previous poll.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-treasury-names-acting-senior-sanctions-official-3552297,"By Daphne Psaledakis WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Brad Smith, a veteran U.S. Treasury Department employee, will be acting under secretary for terrorism and financial intelligence, a U.S. Treasury Department spokesperson told Reuters, taking up the role overseeing the department's sanctions policy, one of Washington's go-to foreign policy tools. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Smith's appointment comes as the U.S. seeks to increase pressure on Russia over its 2022 invasion of Ukraine and maintains heavy punitive measures against countries such as Iran. Reuters first reported Smith would assume the role. CONTEXT Smith will take over the position in an acting capacity following the departure of Brian Nelson on Friday, the spokesperson said. Sources confirmed Nelson was leaving to work on the presidential campaign of Vice President Kamala Harris. Smith's focus will be on continuing to degrade Russia’s ability to wage war in Ukraine, the spokesperson said, as well as cutting off financing to Iran and its proxies, combating the illicit flow of fentanyl into the U.S. and implementing regulatory efforts. Smith was appointed director of Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control in 2023. He previously served as the office’s deputy director and chief counsel. Under President Joe Biden's administration, Smith has worked on Washington's imposition of thousands of sanctions targeting Russia over the invasion of Ukraine, which has included designations of Russian banks, oligarchs, President Vladimir Putin and companies in China, Turkey and elsewhere. The Biden administration has also ramped up counter-narcotics measures and sought to modernize the use of the sanctions tool. During the previous administration of President Donald Trump, the office issued extensive measures against Iran and Venezuela, among others."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/boes-pill-says-job-not-done-on-inflation-rates-might-not-fall-again-soon-3552296,"LONDON (Reuters) -Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said on Friday that the fight against high inflation was not won and there was no guarantee that interest rates would fall again soon. ""I think we can't be complacent, we can't declare 'job done' because there are some sort of dynamics in the UK economy, a sort of persistent component, that we need to be cautious about,"" Pill told an online presentation organised by the BoE. ""I think we shouldn't be yet promising that rates are going to move down further in the very short term,"" he said. Pill voted against the BoE's decision to cut borrowing costs for the first time in more than four years which was announced on Thursday. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey, who was part of the five-strong majority on the Monetary Policy Committee which backed the cut in Bank Rate, has also said the timing of further reductions in borrowing costs remains to be determined. Investors are fully pricing another quarter-point reduction in Bank Rate - which now stands at 5.0% - in November. Inflation in Britain has fallen from more than 11% in October 2022 to 2% in the most recent data, but wage growth and inflation in the services sector remain stronger, representing risks for price growth ahead. In his comments on Friday, Pill said progress on tackling inflation was being made but Britain was ""not out of the woods."" He also said he did not believe above-inflation increases in public sector pay announced by the government posed a big inflationary risk."

In April, Wojcicki notified the company of her intention to make an offer and take the company private. She followed it up with a non-binding proposal, disclosed in a regulatory filing on Wednesday, to acquire all outstanding shares of 23andMe not already owned by her or her affiliates for $0.40 per share. A special committee formed by the company rejected the CEO's proposal as it saw the offer as insufficient and not in the best interests of the non-affiliated shareholders. Wojcicki had indicated in her proposal that she was working with advisers and intended to begin speaking to potential partners and financing sources. The committee in its response said it was prepared to provide her and potential investors additional time to submit a revised proposal in line with the company's expectation. Other alternatives will be pursued to maximize value for shareholders, in the absence of a revised offer, the panel added. 23andMe, best known for its saliva-based test kits that offer users a glimpse into their genetic ancestry, went public in 2021."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/new-middle-east-crisis-could-trigger-a-big-spike-in-volatility-warns-bca-research-3551910,"Market volatility is expected to spike again as investors begin to take into account the prospect of rising oil prices amid the latest Middle East crisis and slowing global economic growth, strategists at BCA Research said Wednesday. The research firm upped their subjective odds of a major oil supply shock to 37% and emphasized the 60% chance of Republican victory in the upcoming election. “Tactically investors should stay overweight energy stocks relative to other cyclicals and favor oil producers in the Americas rather than Middle East,” BCA Research said in a note. Fighting between Israel and Hezbollah is intensifying. The situation escalated further after Hamas’ top political leader was killed in an airstrike in Tehran this week, with Iran blaming Israel and vowing revenge. The U.S. has also conducted preemptive strikes in Iraq to protect troops from Iran-backed forces, pointing to rising tensions as Iran signals resumed attacks on U.S. troops. Against this backdrop, investors are now closely watching global oil markets, anticipating a short-term spike in prices. This volatility is expected to persist until Hezbollah and Iran have retaliated, and the extent of the damage is assessed, BCA said. The firm notes that the current macroeconomic outlook supports this volatility, with weakening global demand as the U.S. economy slips, China’s lack of significant economic stimulus, and Europe on the brink of recession. But the risk of oil supply shocks is also expected to rise after the U.S. election, regardless of the outcome, strategists said, “because Biden is a lame duck and will need to cement his legacy, which may involve disciplining Iran for betraying his trust, expanding its nuclear program, and attacking Israel and international shipping."" Beyond oil volatility, the Middle East escalation could impact markets by influencing the U.S. election. The situation, coupled with Russia's restriction of energy production and exports, could reinforce inflation or otherwise affect the ruling party."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/columnus-treasury-futures-in-unchartered-waters-as-fed-cuts-loom-mcgeever-3549848,"By Jamie McGeever ORLANDO, Florida (Reuters) -As the first U.S. interest rate cut in this cycle draws closer, long and short positions in the Treasury futures market, and overnight repo lending volumes, have never been higher. And these record numbers could get even bigger if the Fed can deliver a soft landing for the economy - something it's only ever really done once before, in the 1990s. Is this a cause for concern? As is the case in any financial market, the security of investors' positioning depends on two key factors: volatility and liquidity. Right now Treasury market volatility appears subdued and liquidity appears ample. On one side of the trade, asset managers, pension funds and institutional investors are hoovering up risk-free government bonds to lock into attractive yields before they start falling in tandem with the policy rate. They do this by going 'long' bonds in the liquid Treasury futures market. On the other side, hedge funds are 'short' and selling the futures, hedging their exposure by buying equivalent and slightly cheaper cash bonds with funds borrowed in the highly leveraged overnight repo market. Pocketing the tiny price difference between futures and cash bonds is known as the 'basis trade'. Regulators from the Bank for International Settlements to the Bank of England have warned about the financial stability risks that a sudden unwind in these positions could trigger. While this is a dog that hasn't barked, far less bitten, the numbers involved now are eye-watering, in nominal and relative terms. Commodity Futures Trading Commission figures show that asset managers' aggregate long position across two-, five- and 10-year futures is worth $1.1 trillion, and leveraged funds' corresponding short position totals $1.05 trillion. These are record amounts, dominated by activity at the interest rate-sensitive shorter end of the curve. As a share of total open interest, asset manager longs are 55% and leveraged fund shorts are 52%. In February 2020, just before the basis trade last blew up, asset manager longs were 42% of open interest and hedge fund shorts were 38%. Regulators' concerns are not unwarranted. New York Fed data, meanwhile, shows that the amount of overnight cash borrowed at the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) last month hit a record $2.175 trillion. This is a sign that investors are leveraging up purchases of cash bonds to hedge their short futures position. ""Repo volumes are surging. This tells me that this is a resurgence of the basis trade,"" says Joseph Wang, chief investment officer at Monetary Macro and a former senior trader on the Fed's open markets desk. CHECKERED FLAG Trillion dollar positions, especially highly leveraged ones, are obviously a potential worry. But they can stay large without issue as long as parties on both sides of the trade remain comfortable. And there currently seems to be little indication that those operating in the Treasury futures markets are anything but comfortable. Despite regular gripes from some quarters about Treasury market liquidity - 'a mile wide, but an inch deep' - liquidity appears to be pretty good. In fact, market depth has been trending upward for most notes and bonds since the U.S. regional banking crisis in March 2023, according to a 'Liberty Street Economics' blog from New York Fed staffers published earlier this year. So buyers and sellers are currently able to trade easily at almost any price or size without disrupting the market. Volatility, meanwhile, has been relatively low for some time in this market. Can we expect this positioning to become even more extreme? That depends on the nature of the Fed's easing cycle - falling rates can sustain the basis trade but rapid and large declines may trigger a disorderly unwind Fed Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday that policymakers had ""a real discussion"" about cutting rates, but decided to stay on hold and weigh the incoming data. A rate cut at the next meeting in September ""could be on the table."" Either way, Powell's comments will likely stoke asset managers' demand for Treasuries - five- and 10-year yields are now below 4% for the first time in six months. Rick Rieder, chief investment officer of global fixed income at BlackRock (NYSE: ), the world's largest asset manager overseeing $2.8 trillion in fixed income assets, says Powell's signal was a ""checkered flag"" for bond-hungry investors. ""Today confirmed that status, and consequently can be seen as supporting the recent trend of persistent flows out of cash into longer-dated fixed income assets,"" Rieder wrote in a client note on Wednesday. If so, these massive positions in Treasury futures and overnight repo volumes will keep getting bigger. Whether bigger means riskier is still an open question.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/columncentral-bank-dam-burst-may-see-dash-from-cash-mike-dolan-3551117,"By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) -Catch the cresting wave? After numerous bruising false starts, there's now a dash to lock onto what are still some of the highest government and corporate bond yields in 15 years before they evaporate as central bank easing finally gets underway in earnest. Emboldened by headline inflation back at target and likely tax rises from the new British government, the Bank of England narrowly voted for its first interest rate cut in four years this week. That cut came within 24 hours of the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling it was ready to likewise cut rates in seven weeks time. Although laced with ""softly softly"" rhetoric and caution about ""data dependency"", these two are merely catching up on the start already made by the central banks in the euro zone, Switzerland, Sweden and Canada. And with real inflation-adjusted policy rates rising sharply to their tightest levels since the global banking crash of 2008, labor markets loosening and manufacturing growth stalling, there appears to be a consensus that now is the time to move to ensure they are not scrambling later on if the economic slowdown snowballs. Short-dated government bonds are leading the charge. Two-year U.S. Treasury yields have clocked a cumulative 50-basis-point (bp) swoon in the space of a month to hit their lowest levels since February. Two-year UK gilt yields have shed as much in that time to plumb their lowest levels in more than year. But it occurred across the curve - with 10-year Treasuries losing their 4% handle for the first time in six months. Europe rallied in sympathy, with even recently edgy French 10-year government yields falling back below 3% for the first time since a contentious snap election was called there in June. And the widest sweep of global bond markets at large - the Bloomberg Multiverse index of government and corporate bonds - has seen implied yields plummet through 4% again to their lowest levels since early February. LEAK OUT THE CURVE There have been false dawns before of course. The combination of creeping industrial slowdowns and better-behaved inflation, and wariness of many pricey equity markets, means still-brimming coffers of cautious cash may now start to leak out as short-term money market rates tumble. The rush to secure a longer period of fixed returns in bonds while yields there are still historically high seems a likely first port of call. And there's still a lot of money in cash. According to ICI data, total assets in U.S. money market funds rose to the highest level on record this week at some $6.14 trillion - almost $1.6 trillion more than was there before the Fed started lifting rates in March 2022. The question is whether it's now worth shifting to what are now much lower longer-term yields. Anticipating a Fed move from its 5.38% policy mid-rate in September, three-month Treasury bill rates have slipped 10 bp over the month to 5.28% - but they remain 110 bp above fast disappearing two-year yield at 4.2%. And yet futures markets already price a likely series of Fed cuts ahead that would bring policy rates below the current two-year Treasury by March of next year - and two-year notes themselves would almost certainly be far lower by then if that scenario unfolded. All things equal, the current rates universe suggests a new two-year note bought today would yield more than a 3-month T-bill for 18 months of its maturity. Analysts at TS Lombard earlier this year calculated that current two-year yields are still attractive even if you assume the 200 bp of Fed easing in this cycle now priced by futures markets ""normalizes"" the yield curve and returns a premium on two-year yields over Fed policy rates to a 50-year average of 30 bp. And even if you think 200 bp sounds like a lot of easing, bear in mind that would still leave Fed policy rates at twice the 20-year average and almost 60 bp above what Fed policymakers see as long-term neutral - still 'restrictive' in the parlance of the U.S. central bank. The upshot is that the temptation to move cash holdings further out the curve may now prove irresistible and bond markets seem to see that wave coming at last.

After September's presidential election in the Indian Ocean nation, the global lender will discuss the timing for a review of progress in meeting key commitments as part of a $2.9- billion bailout, the IMF said in a statement. The IMF has also provided Colombo and financial advisors of the country's bondholders an assessment on a provisional deal Sri Lanka reached last month to restructure $12.5 billion in debt. ""We encourage a swift resolution of the remaining steps to achieve debt sustainability and regain investor confidence. We will continue to support Sri Lanka’s ongoing debt restructuring efforts,"" the global lender added. Cash-strapped Sri Lanka plunged into its worst financial crisis in more than seven decades in 2022 with a severe dollar shortage sending inflation soaring to a high of 70%, its currency to record lows and its economy contracting 7.3%. The IMF bailout secured in March last year helped to stabilise economic conditions. The rupee has risen 7% in recent months and inflation slowed to 2.4% in July. The economy is expected to grow 3% this year for the first time since the crisis. The country also signed agreements with Japan, India, China and other creditor nations in June to restructure about $10 billion in bilateral debt. But Sri Lanka is heading to a presidential election on September 21 the outcome of which could potentially impact policy changes including crucial measures to put its public finances on track, combat corruption and attract fresh investment. ""With Sri Lanka’s knife-edged recovery at a critical juncture, sustaining the reform momentum and ensuring timely implementation of all program commitments are critical to cement the hard-won economic progress to date and put the economy on a firm footing,"" the IMF said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/payrolls-slumping-stocks-apple-amazon--whats-moving-markets-3551251,"Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to end the week on a losing note as weak activity data has investors fretting about the possibility of a U.S. recession. Nonfarm payrolls will be studied for growth clues, while results from tech heavyweights Apple and Amazon will also be in the spotlight. 1. Payrolls loom large Friday’s economic highlight will be the release of the closely watched report, as investors seek further clues on the health of the U.S. labor market and the broader economy. Economists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month. The , which has ticked higher in each of the past three months, is expected to hold steady at 4.1%. The kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range on Wednesday, where it has been since last July, but also opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September. In the accompanying statement the Fed softened the description of inflation and said the risks to employment were now on a par with those of rising prices. Data released earlier this week showed that U.S. fell modestly in June, while for unemployment benefits increased to an 11-month high last week. A weak U.S. report also added to fears of an economic downturn and led investors to worry that the Federal Reserve may be behind the curve in cutting rates. 2. Futures fall on recession fears U.S. stock futures fell Friday, as investors digested some disappointing earnings from the important tech sector while awaiting the release of the widely-watched monthly nonfarm payrolls report. By 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the contract was 225 points, or 0.5%, lower, dropped 48 points, or 0.9%, and fell by 295 points, or 1.6%. The Wall Street indices closed sharply lower Thursday after a softer-than-expected ISM report on U.S. manufacturing caused investors to fret about a possible recession. The dropped 1.4%, the fell 2.3% and the slumped almost 500 points, or 1.2%. Investors will be focusing upon the official jobs report [see above] for more clues of the strength of the U.S. labor market, with risk sentiment ending the week on the back foot. Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) released their earnings after the close Thursday [see below] and will be in the spotlight, as will Intel (NASDAQ: ) after the chipmaker said it would cut more than 15% of its workforce and suspend its dividend starting in the fourth quarter as it pursues a turnaround. Staying on the earnings front, oil majors (NYSE: ) and (NYSE: ) will be announcing their quarterly results Friday before the market open. 3. Apple impresses despite Chinese woes Apple reported Thursday third-quarter results that topped Wall Street estimates, as a jump in services revenue helped offset softer iPhone revenue amid rising competition in China. The tech giant’s stock rose 0.6% after hours, adding to gains of nearly 30% in the past three months, resulting in gains of around 13% over the course of this year. Apple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than expectations. Services revenue rose 14% to record high of $24.21 billion, beating Wall Street estimates of $24.01 billion. Sales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected, although China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%. Apple has taken to discounting its iPhones in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei. Despite these difficulties, things could get better next quarter, as analysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September. The company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June, and to operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices. 4. Amazon reports slowing online sales growth Amazon stock slumped after hours after the online retail giant reported slowing online sales growth in the second quarter, adding that price-conscious consumers were acting cautiously. Amazon’s online stores sales rose 5% in the second quarter to $55.4 billion, compared with growth of 7% in the first quarter. Additionally, the company offered up third-quarter revenue guidance of $154-158.5 billion, short of expectations of $158.2 billion. CFO Brian Olsavsky told reporters on a call that consumers ""are continuing to be cautious with their spending trading down."" ""They are looking for deals,"" he added, noting that lower priced products were selling briskly. This news has overshadowed generally positive results, with second-quarter profit and cloud computing sales beating analyst estimates. Amazon stock fell almost 7% after hours, but were still up over 20% year-to-date. 5. Crude on track for fourth straight losing week Crude prices rose Friday, but were on course for a fourth straight week of losses given mounting concerns over slowing economic growth. By 04:10 ET, the futures (WTI) climbed 1.1% to $77.18 a barrel, while the contract rose 1% to $80.32 a barrel. Both benchmarks have declined around 8% over the last four weeks as disappointing economic data from top oil importer China and surveys showing weaker manufacturing activity across Asia, Europe and the United States raised concerns of weak global economic growth, weighing on oil consumption. The weak economic prints saw markets largely look past heightened tensions in the Middle East after the killing of a Hamas leader in Iran earlier in the week. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, made no changes to its production policies after an online meeting on Thursday, reiterating that it could pause plans to increase output from October."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/indonesia-finance-minister-sees-q2-gdp-growth-at-5-flags-geopolitical-risks-3551173,"By Gayatri Suroyo and Bernadette Christina JAKARTA (Reuters) -Indonesia's economic growth probably slowed slightly to 5% in the second quarter and authorities are monitoring geopolitical developments that could affect the domestic economy, its finance minister said on Friday. Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati said household consumption, investment and improving exports had likely driven growth in the April-June quarter. The figure would represent only a slight slowdown from the 5.11% annual expansion Southeast Asia's economy recorded in the first quarter. ""Going forward, we see that the increase in domestic economic activity will continue until the end of 2024,"" she said. ""From the fiscal side, the execution of the 2024 budget, particularly on the spending side, will be focused on maintaining price stability."" For all of 2024, Indonesia's economic growth is expected to be within a range of 5% to 5.2%, she said. The minister's second-quarter estimate is in line with a forecast in a Reuters poll of 24 economists, who pointed to moderating exports and the dampening impact of high interest rates on consumption as factors weighing on growth. The data will be released on Monday. In a joint press conference with other officials, Sri Mulyani said financial authorities discussed geopolitical developments to anticipate risks that could affect Indonesia's economy, including tensions in the Middle East, the war in Ukraine and elections in other countries. She said these risks, as well as global uncertainties regarding the timing of U.S. monetary easing, Washington's debt plans and Treasury yield curve, will limit capital inflows to emerging markets, including Indonesia. Speaking at the same event, Bank Indonesia (BI) Governor Perry Warjiyo said that while low inflation created room for lower interest in recent months, the central bank could not cut rates yet because it was focusing on mitigating the spillover impact of global risks on the rupiah exchange rate. BI had previously anticipated the U.S. Federal Reserve would cut rates in December, but its meeting this week suggested a probability of a rate cut in September, Warjiyo said. Warjiyo has previously said BI may have room to cut rates in the fourth quarter, after global uncertainties ease"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/exclusivegerman-chancellor-lines-up-fresh-crisis-talks-with-property-titans-3551123,"By Tom Sims, John O'Donnell and Matthias Inverardi FRANKFURT (Reuters) - German Chancellor Olaf Scholz is launching a fresh bid to tackle a property crisis as the country braces for recession and elections that could bolster the far right. The government has scheduled a meeting of politicians, ministries and industry representatives in Hamburg on Dec. 6, two top industry officials said. The meeting will address the housing shortage in Europe's most populous country, one exacerbated by the failure of major developers and a crash in investment and financing as real estate prices slumped. The last such gathering in September produced a raft of government proposals but little concrete action. ""It shows something is happening,"" Iris Schoeberl, president of the German Property Federation representing 37,000 firms, said of the renewed effort. ""It also sends a strong signal to the people that the chancellor is tackling the issue."" Tim-Oliver Mueller, head of the German Construction Industry Federation, lamented that ""much of what was discussed previously has come to nothing"". ""We need concrete steps and real action,"" he said. Germany's 730 billion euro property industry contributes a fifth of the country's output, eclipsing its auto sector. Industry leaders have been pushing for changes including a cut to Germany's property sales tax, which can be 6% of the price of a home, and relaxing rules to make it cheaper to build. The government didn't respond to a request for comment. The housing ministry said it was working to support the industry with measures such as speeding up the building approvals process. For years, low interest rates and a strong economy fuelled a German property boom, which ended in 2022 when rampant inflation forced the European Central Bank to swiftly raise borrowing costs. The ensuing funk resulted in a slowing of deals, stalled projects and top developers going bust. Recent data still shows an accelerating fall in building permits for apartments, and another plummet in new building starts in the first half of the year. While the ECB's June rate cut sparked hopes of a revival, executives remain cautious. Rolf Buch, chief executive of one of the nation's biggest landlords Vonovia, which reported another loss for the first half of the year, predicts more property companies will go bust. Germany has failed to meet its goal of building 400,000 apartments a year as millions flock to the country to escape wars and in search of work. The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which has campaigned for policies to support housing, has a chance of winning state elections later this year as the popularity of Scholz's three-way coalition slips ahead of a 2025 federal vote. ""The housing shortage can lead to populists increasingly taking up the issue with supposedly simple answers,"" warned the German Property Federation's Schoeberl. Scholz, who is regularly confronted about the lack of affordable housing, told one gathering in Mainz earlier this year: ""We must find a way so that housing goes up where it is sought and needed."" After spending tens of billions to tackle the energy crisis and boost defence spending, Germany has little left for the property crisis, with Mueller also blaming fragmented responsibility between the federal government and the 16 states for hobbling a response. Felix Pakleppa, chief executive of the ZDB industry association representing 35,000 building firms, said there should be subsidies and fewer energy-related regulations. ""We in Germany have become accustomed to the gold standard for technical building specifications, which has made construction projects ever more demanding and costly,"" he said. Since the September meeting, the drumbeat of bad news has continued, with the collapse of Rene Benko's Signa real estate empire, which had a major footprint in Germany, one of the more notable failures. Some banks have also come under stress while a Frankfurt skyscraper home to Germany's central bank and asset manager Deka filed for insolvency. Apollo-owned Demire also said four subsidiaries will file for insolvency after its bank refused to renegotiate a loan. Schoeberl, meanwhile, is pushing for measures to allow developers to build quickly, and for consistently low interest loans from a government-backed bank. ""What real estate needs is trust and the ability to plan,"" she said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-central-bank-adviser-calls-for-greater-stimulus-inflation-goal-3551114,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China should ramp up its fiscal stimulus to spur economic growth and set a firm inflation target to prevent the country falling into a ""low inflation trap"", a central bank policy adviser said in remarks seen on Friday. China's leaders signalled this week that fiscal support for the rest of the year will ""focus on consumption"", aiming to boost incomes and social welfare, following plans to use funds from government bonds to finance trade-ins on consumer goods. ""We need to increase the intensity of macroeconomic policies, especially to implement the already arranged fiscal expenditures as soon as possible,"" Huang Yiping, a policy adviser to the People's Bank of China (PBOC), said in an article published by Peking University's National School of Development on its Wechat account. Huang, an influential Chinese economist who heads the school, suggested that if central bank and finance ministry policies are too conservative in an effort to try to maintain policy stability, they could end up undermining economic stability. ""If policies are conservative, once they affect economic stability, there will be no more policy stability,"" he said. China should quicken fiscal spending and policymakers should shift their stance from prioritising investment over consumption, said Huang, calling for steps to allow more migrant workers to settle in cities and give cash handouts to residents. The world's second-largest economy grew at a slower than expected 4.7% in the second quarter and faces deflationary pressures, with retail sales and imports significantly underperforming industrial output and exports. The government has set an economic growth target of around 5% for 2024. The government should set a ""rigid"" annual consumer inflation target of 2%-3% and elevate the goal of achieving moderate inflation to be on a par with the economic growth objective, Huang said. ""If we really fall into the ""low inflation trap"", the consequences will be very serious,"" he said. China has long set an inflation target of about 3%, but actual price rises have significantly missed the target in recent years. Economists says that persistently low inflation can drag on economic activity and make it more difficult for policymakers to promote growth."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/apple-revenue-returns-to-growth-as-iphone-sales-top-expectations-3550477,"By Max A. Cherney and Aditya Soni (Reuters) -Apple said its third-quarter iPhone sales were better than expected and forecast more gains on Thursday as it bets on artificial intelligence to attract buyers, even as its overall China business disappointed. Shares of the company rose nearly 1% in extended trading, outperforming other tech stocks that were broadly lower. Apple (NASDAQ: ) is expected to launch this fall what analysts have called the biggest software upgrade for the iPhone. It includes artificial intelligence features and comes at a time when rivals such as Samsung have been quicker to roll out similar services. Apple said revenue in its fiscal fourth quarter would grow at a level similar to the 4.9% increase it posted in the April-June period, which was better than analysts' estimates. Sales of iPhone also improved in the third quarter, falling just 0.9% compared with the 2.2% drop analysts expected. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri told Reuters in an interview that the iPhone results were better than he had expected three months ago. ""The iPhone 15 family has been doing well from the very beginning and still now - we have three quarters of the year behind us. It is performing better than the previous cycle, the iPhone 14."" Still, China - Apple's third-largest market - remained a drag as sales there declined 6.5%. While that was an improvement from the 8.1% decline in the previous quarter, it was wider than expectations for a drop of 2.4%, according to Visible Alpha. Maestri said China sales fell less than 3%, excluding the effects of foreign exchange and added that he feels good about Apple's performance in that country, given any softness in its economy. Apple has taken to discounting its iPhones in China to compete with the much cheaper alternative smartphones offered by local competitors such as Huawei. The company in May offered discounts of up to 2,300 yuan ($317) on selected models. AI PUSH Analysts expect a strong upgrade cycle for the iPhone 16 series, likely to be launched in September. The company unveiled a raft of AI products and services it calls Apple Intelligence at its developer conference in June. To operate Apple Intelligence requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro, which may push consumers to upgrade their devices. While some analysts said that some consumers might have purchased the top-end iPhone 15 devices to tap the upcoming Apple Intelligence features, CEO Tim Cook told investors on Thursday it was ""too early to tell"" if that was driving upgrades. Apple's AI features have arrived later than offerings by rivals including Samsung Electronics (KS: ), which has introduced competing devices aimed at hosting AI chatbots. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: )'s Google are placing huge bets on AI as well. ""The company's future success depends on two factors: keeping AI development costs low and ensuring that new AI-driven features compel price-sensitive consumers to upgrade their devices,"" said Emarketer analyst Jacob Bourne. Apple started ramping up research and development spending last year, and Cook has said it has spent more than $100 billion on R&D in the past five years. Maestri told Reuters on Thursday that the company maintains ""very good gross margins"" despite the sometimes burdensome costs associated with building and running AI applications. Apple splits its AI infrastructure costs between its own data centers and other cloud providers with whom it contracts. On the regulatory front, Apple faces three probes in the European Union related to the Digital Markets Act, which requires large tech companies to ensure a level playing field for rivals and give users more choice. The bloc's antitrust regulator has accused Apple's App Store of breaching the DMA. In the United States, the Department of Justice in March accused Apple of monopolizing the smartphone market and driving up prices. Apple's quarterly earnings per share were $1.40, above Wall Street estimates of $1.35, according to LSEG data. Sales in Apple's services segment, which includes the App Store and represents Apple Music and TV products, rose 14.1% to $24.21 billion, above analyst expectations of $24.01 billion, according to LSEG data. Mac sales grew 2.5% to $7.01 billion, compared with estimates of $7.02 billion, according to LSEG data. The company's sales in the iPad segment increased by 23.7% to $7.16 billion, above analyst expectations of $6.61 billion, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for a product line that had languished for the past two years. In the company's wearables segment, which represents sales of Apple Watches and AirPods headphones, sales fell 2.3% to $8.10 billion, compared with analyst estimates of $7.79 billion, according to LSEG data. Apple maintained its dividend at 25 cents. In the fiscal second quarter, Apple announced a $110 billion stock buyback."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/japans-economy-likely-rebounded-in-q2-on-consumption-pickup-reuters-poll-3551081,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan's economy likely rebounded in the April-June period after shrinking in the previous quarter thanks to a pick-up in factory output and consumption, a Reuters poll showed, helping the central bank make the case for further interest rate hikes. But the yen's recent rally and signs of slowdown in the U.S. economy may emerge as fresh risks to the export-reliant economy, some analysts say. Japan's real gross domestic product (GDP) is expected to have expanded an annualised 2.1% in April-June, according to a median forecast of economists polled by Reuters, rebounding from a 2.9% contraction in the previous quarter. Private consumption likely rose 0.5%, marking the first increase in five quarters, as bumper pay hikes offered by companies in spring wage negotiations begin to boost household income, the poll showed. ""While slowing global demand and rising inflation will continue to drag on growth, Japan's economy will get a lift form strong wage growth and a pick-up in auto output,"" said Saisuke Sakai, an economist at Mizuho Research & Technologies. Capital expenditure is expected to have increased 0.9% after a 0.4% drop in January-March, the poll showed, underscoring the Bank of Japan's view that robust corporate spending will underpin growth. Net external demand likely shaved a 0.1 percentage point off GDP, the poll showed, less than a 0.4-point negative contribution in the January-March period. The government will release the preliminary second-quarter GDP data at 8:50 a.m. Aug. 15 (2350GMT on Aug. 14). Japan made a rare, unscheduled downgrade to historical GDP that showed the economy contracted more than expected in the first quarter, casting doubt on the strength of its recovery. Consumption has been a soft spot in the economy as rising living costs, blamed in part on a weak yen, hit households before they begin to feel the benefits of higher pay. The Bank of Japan raised interest rates on Wednesday and signalled the chance for further hikes, arguing that consumption will rebound as the wage hikes begin to make their way into the economy."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/japan-warns-of-weak-yen-impact-on-households-in-government-white-paper-3551065,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) - A weak yen is hurting Japanese households' sentiment and could erode their purchasing power, the government said in a report on Friday, underscoring its concern over the negative economic impact of the currency's fall. When former premier Shinzo Abe's administration deployed its ""Abenomics"" stimulus policies in 2013, rising inflation expectations helped improve household sentiment, the government said in an annual white paper analysing the economy. But a renewed rise in inflation expectations since mid-2023 has soured households' mood, partly because the public reacted to media reports about rising food prices and the boost to import costs from a weak yen, it said. ""A weak yen risks eroding consumers' purchasing power"" by pushing up inflation more than wage growth, the paper said. After languishing at 38-lows below 160 per dollar for much of July, the yen staged a sharp rally in the days leading up to and after the Bank of Japan's decision on Wednesday to raise interest rates. It stood at 149.07 to the dollar in Asia on Friday as investors began shifting their focus on prospects of steady rate hikes by the BOJ, which would come in the face of an expected start to the U.S. monetary easing cycle by the Federal Reserve as soon as September. In the white paper that was prepared well before Wednesday's BOJ decision, the government said the yen's declines no longer push up export volume as much as in the past as more Japanese manufacturers shift production overseas. Rather, a weak yen weighs on smaller firms' profits by boosting raw material import costs, the report said. A weak yen has become a source of concern for Japanese policymakers as it has dampened consumption by inflating the cost of importing fuel, food and raw material. Japanese authorities spent 5.53 trillion yen ($37 billion) intervening in the foreign exchange market in July to pull the yen off 38-year lows past 160 per dollar, official data showed. The Bank of Japan also cited the risk of an inflation overshoot from a weak yen as among reasons for raising interest rates on Wednesday. ($1 = 149.5400 yen)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/rba-no-longer-expected-to-hike-rates-in-2024-but-cuts-also-unlikely-rabobank-3551037,"Investing.com-- The Reserve Bank of Australia is no longer expected to hike interest rates in 2024 following some signs of easing inflation in the second quarter, Rabobank analysts said, although chances of a rate cut remained slim. The central bank is set to meet next week, but is widely expected to at 4.35% after read mildly cooler than expected for the June quarter. The second-quarter trimmed mean CPI data was in line with the RBA’s forecast, and a fall in non-tradables and services inflation presented a greater chance that the central bank will keep rates steady, Benjamin Picton, Senior Strategist at Rabobank said in a social media post. Services inflation in particular was a key point of concern for the RBA, with the central bank having signaled earlier that services still presented upside risks for price pressures. While the second-quarter CPI reading did show an uptick in some inflation- particularly from imports and steady consumer spending, it was unlikely that the RBA will have enough impetus to hike rates further. Still, the central bank is also unlikely to cut interest rates anytime soon, considering that inflation still remains comfortably above the RBA’s 2% to 3% annual target. Rabobank only expects the RBA to begin cutting rates from the second quarter of 2025."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/rba-to-hold-rates-steady-in-august-first-cut-seen-in-early-2025-reuters-poll-3551022,"By Devayani Sathyan BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of Australia will hold interest rates on Tuesday at near a 13-year high and wait until the first quarter of 2025 before reducing them, according to economists polled by Reuters, as price pressures remain elevated. Inflation unexpectedly rose to a six-month high of 4.0% in May from 3.6% previously, triggering a flurry of speculation in markets that the RBA would raise rates. But after inflation dipped to 3.8% last month, along with weaker-than-expected price pressures across the second quarter, that pricing was wiped out. Still, with inflation well above the central bank's 2%-3% target range, the RBA will hold the official cash rate at 4.35% this year, according to the July 31-Aug. 1 Reuters poll. All but one of 33 economists surveyed expected the central bank to leave rates unchanged on Aug. 6. The median forecast and majority view put rates on hold through the end of this year, unchanged from the previous poll. In a survey taken before the June 18 meeting, more than 60% of economists had predicted at least one cut before the end of 2024. No one forecast any change to rates at the September meeting in the latest poll. ""The Q2 inflation report almost certainly takes August off the table for a potential rate hike from the RBA. We still think the underlying strength in the economy is sufficient that they will have to maintain a bit of a hawkish bias,"" said Ben Picton, senior strategist at Rabobank. ""Up until (the) inflation report, it was our expectation they would hike rates in 2024. So we think a cut this year is probably a bridge too far. They won't do that,"" Picton said. Among major local banks, ANZ, and NAB predict rates will stay unchanged through 2024, while CBA and Westpac see one cut before the end of this year. Two-thirds of economists polled, 22 of 33, forecast no change to the key rate before 2025. Only 10 saw at least one 25-basis-point cut in the fourth quarter while one forecast it at 4.60%. Market pricing showed a roughly 55% probability of a rate cut by the end of 2024, suggesting the RBA will lag the U.S. Federal Reserve, which is forecast to cut rates twice this year and four times in 2025. ""The view was always that the RBA was a reluctant hiker and it simply meant the official cash rate was going to be held higher for a lot longer relative to other developed markets,"" said Craig Vardy, head of fixed income at BlackRock (NYSE: ) Australasia. ""The path forward from here is going to be a very slow burn into 2025 ... We've got a terminal RBA cash rate at 3.60%. We've had that for quite a while, so that tells you three rate cuts and they're done."" Inflation was forecast to average 3.4% this year and 2.8% in 2025, a separate Reuters poll found. Median forecasts in the latest survey showed the RBA cutting rates by 75 basis points next year, putting the official cash rate at 3.60% by the end of 2025."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/analysischina-needs-more-than-incremental-consumer-stimulus-longer-term-3550918,"HONG KONG (Reuters) - China's efforts to boost household spending are expected to help the economy hit the government's 2024 growth target of roughly 5%, but the authorities may have to do more for consumers from next year or accept slower growth. Trade tensions and local government debt risks leave Beijing few alternatives to revving up consumer stimulus in coming years, but vague promises of ""incremental measures"" look likely to fall short, analysts say. China's leaders signalled this week that fiscal support for the rest of the year will ""focus on consumption"", aiming to boost incomes and social welfare, days after announcing plans to use 150 billion yuan ($20 billion) in government debt to finance trade-ins on consumer goods such as appliances. This marks a departure toward boosting chronically weak domestic demand after decades of reliance on exports and infrastructure spending that helped vault China to the world's second-biggest economy. Still, the trade-in programme, China's first debt-funded step to directly support household consumption nationwide, amounts to just 0.12% of gross domestic product. Further consumption stimulus is ""plausible next year in the face of potentially stronger external headwinds"", Citi analysts said. The fridges-not-bridges shift is driven by growing unease with China's trade dominance, which has pushed the United States, Europe and emerging economies from Turkey to Indonesia to raise tariffs and place other barriers on Chinese products. In addition, the authorities are growing wary of debt-funded projects as they increase scrutiny on heavily indebted municipalities. Most of China's fiscal stimulus still goes into investment, but returns are dwindling and the spending has saddled local governments with $13 trillion in debt. Local governments sold 1.49 trillion yuan ($200 billion) of the special bonds used to fund stimulus in the first half of the year, just 38% of the full-year quota, making China's fiscal stance unexpectedly tight. ""The number of really good projects that produce stable income keeps getting smaller,"" an economic adviser to the government said on condition of anonymity. China's export outlook is likely to keep worsening, especially if Donald Trump returns to the White House, as the U.S. former president and Republican candidate for November's election has threatened tariffs of up to 60% on all Chinese goods. Yue Su, principal China economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit, estimates that a 10% increase in U.S. import tariffs could cut China's real economic growth by 0.3-0.4 percentage points next year and in 2026. ""The urgency to stimulate the domestic economy is highlighted by increased external pressures, including the potential return of Trump,"" she said. ""A more decisive domestic-focussed policy and fiscal expansion could mitigate some of these effects."" 'POOR' RECORD ON CONSUMER STIMULUS China's household spending is less than 40% of GDP, some 20 percentage points below the global average. To revive consumption just to its pre-pandemic trendline would require 3 trillion yuan to 8 trillion yuan ($400 billion-$1 trillion) in spending, said Christopher Beddor, deputy China research director at Gavekal Dragonomics estimates, who thinks that much stimulus is unlikely. ""The government's track record of delivering on consumer stimulus is frankly pretty poor,"" he said. Xu Hongcai, deputy director of the economic policy commission at the state-backed China Association of Policy Science, said boosting demand sufficiently might need re-allocating 5 trillion yuan from investment projects to consumers. ""In the short run, 5 trillion yuan in stimulus would be forceful,"" Xu said. ""But in the long run, we need to improve the proportion of income of urban and rural residents by 20 percentage points of national income."" ($1 = 7.2373 renminbi)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/morning-bid-markets-wilt-as-growth-fears-slam-yields-3550771,"By Jamie McGeever (Reuters) - A look at the day ahead in Asian markets. Falling bond yields and the prospect of lower interest rates may have helped fuel investors' animal spirits and the recent mega rally in world stocks, but it's a different story when borrowing costs are falling because recession fears are rising. That's the market landscape investors in Asia wake up to on Friday after disappointing U.S. factory data on Thursday slammed U.S. Treasury yields, Wall Street, and stocks, prompting traders to start betting on a possible 50 basis point rate cut from the Fed next month rather than 25 bps. Figures showing a much larger-than-expected contraction in U.S. manufacturing activity last month followed purchasing managers index data earlier on Thursday that painted a similar picture in Germany, Japan and China. China's 'unofficial' Caixin manufacturing PMI was particularly galling at 49.8, signaling a contraction, compared with a consensus forecast of 51.5 and fairly steady growth. With China's economy already in the doldrums, renewed weakness in Europe and the U.S. is bad news for global growth. Central bank rate cuts, the latest of which came from the Bank of England on Thursday, may have to be deeper and faster than analysts and policymakers had bargained for. The tumbled 13 basis points, its biggest one-day fall this year, and is now below 4.0%. Never mind the great rotation out of Mega Tech into small caps, investors seem to be rotating out of stocks and into the safety of U.S. Treasuries. Apple (NASDAQ: ), Amazon (NASDAQ: ) and Intel (NASDAQ: ) reported earnings after the U.S. close on Thursday and the early signs are investors were not impressed. Intel's outlook, in particular, was bleak, and shares fell 15% in after-hours trading. Investors in Asia will be hoping for a calmer end to a momentous week, the highlight of which was a rate hike in Japan. As Washington-based economist Phil Suttle puts it: ""Judged by the actions of other central banks, these were hardly major moves. Judged by Japanese policy over the past 25 years, these were major moves."" So far this year the Bank of Japan has raised rates twice, ended yield curve control and started QT, Suttle noted. Asia's economic calendar on Friday is light, with only South Korean inflation likely to be a market-mover. A Reuters poll suggests the annual rate ticked up to 2.50% in July from a one-year low of 2.40% in June. Swaps market pricing points to 35 basis points of easing from the Bank of Korea this year. Barclays economists on Thursday forecast quarter-point rate cuts in October and November. Asia's corporate calendar on Friday is busier, with earnings reports due from Japan including Nintendo and Sumitomo Mitsui (NYSE: ) Financial Group. Here are key developments that could provide more direction to markets on Friday: - South Korea inflation (July) - Australia producer price inflation (Q2) - U.S. non-farm payrolls (July)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/analysisboj-governors-hawkish-streak-signals-more-hikes-to-come-3547669,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) -Once seen as a cautious policy dove, Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda is now presenting himself as a determined hawk who's not afraid to lift interest rates a few more times, even in the face of a weakening economy. A change in Ueda's commentary comes as the central bank grows more confident that steady wage gains will revive consumption, and reflects concerns that leaving rates low for too long could keep the yen weak and lead to a painful, unpopular inflation overshoot. Recent calls from politicians to combat yen falls with hawkish policy, including from Prime Minister Fumio Kishida, are also emboldening the BOJ to drop signs of future hikes, analysts say. Ueda's latest hawkish hints and Japan's still-low real interest rates mean the BOJ has its eyes set on hiking rates at least to around 0.75%, notwithstanding economic shocks, sources and analysts say. ""Ueda's remarks suggest that even if the economy's momentum is somewhat weak, the BOJ will raise rates further unless its projection of an economic expansion is derailed,"" said Yoshimasa Maruyama, chief market economist at SMBC Nikko Securities. In a press conference explaining the BOJ's decision to raise short-term rates to 0.25% on Wednesday, Ueda said there was ""still quite some distance"" before its policy rate reaches a neutral level that neither cools nor overheats the economy. Ueda also said 0.5%, a level Japan has not seen since 2008, posed no barrier to rates going even higher. While he declined to specify Japan's neutral rate level, three sources familiar with the BOJ's thinking said the dominant view within the central bank is for it to be around 1-1.5%. That suggests the BOJ is pencilling in at least two more 25 basis point hikes to 0.75%. Hikes that big would help remove excessive monetary support but wouldn't create restrictive monetary conditions, and would only need inflation data to move roughly in line with BOJ forecasts. Only when short-term rates approach levels deemed neutral would the BOJ's policy decision become sensitive to more subtle signs of weakness in the economy, the sources said. ""The March policy change was an extraordinary move. After that, it's business as usual,"" one of the sources said on how rates can follow a steady trajectory without much advance hints from the central bank on the specific timing of a change. MORE TO COME When the BOJ ended negative interest rates and other remnants of its massive stimulus in March, the focus of its communication was to avoid jolting markets with too-hawkish signs on the policy outlook. With markets having digested the impact of the March move, the BOJ is now shifting towards sending clearer signals on the prospect of a full-fledged rate hike cycle, the sources said. Underscoring the BOJ's hawkish bent, the BOJ said in a quarterly outlook report on Wednesday that it will ""continue to raise its policy rate"" as long as the economy and inflation move in line with its forecast. That compared with the previous report's language pledging to ""keep financial conditions loose,"" even if the BOJ were to fine-tune the degree of monetary support. The BOJ's decision to hike rates on Wednesday also came despite recent weak signs in consumption, which led many economists to bet it will stand pat to gauge more data. Two dovish members of the board dissented to the rate decision. Ueda escalated his warning on the demerits of the weak yen, saying there was ""quite a significant risk"" the boost it gives to import costs may push up inflation more than expected. His remarks on Wednesday more explicitly linked the inflationary threat to the yen's declines than his previous comments on the currency's impact have. The BOJ's hawkish determination is finally getting across to markets. JPMorgan now expects the BOJ to hike rates to 0.5% in December, followed by two more hikes to 1% by end of 2025. Former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi, who is currently an economist at Nomura Research Institute, thinks the BOJ will aim to push up rates near 1% including through two hikes by early next year. ""Ueda hiked rates this month on the view that inflation was on track to meeting the BOJ's projections,"" said former BOJ official Nobuyasu Atago, currently chief economist at Rakuten Securities Economic Research Institute. ""Judging from the statement's language, one might need to guard against the possibility of another rate hike when the BOJ issues its next outlook report in October,"" he said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/mettlertoledo-forecast-dull-thirdquarter-profit-on-weak-china-demand-3550886,"(Reuters) - Medical equipment maker Mettler-Toledo (NYSE: ) International forecast third-quarter profit below estimates on Thursday, a sign of a weaker-than-expected recovery in sales in its key market China. Lifesciences firms including lab equipment maker Mettler-Toledo have seen sluggish demand for their instruments used in drug development as cash-strapped biotech clients try to navigate a funding crunch amid high interest rates. Slowing growth in China has further crimped demand for Mettler. In its first-quarter earnings, the company had flagged that it continued to see softness in China. ""As expected, market conditions in China remained weak,"" said CEO Patrick Kaltenbach. The firm expects third-quarter adjusted profit to be in the range of $9.90 to $10.05 per share, below estimates of $10.36 per share. Its quarterly sales fell 4% to $946.8 million, above analysts' average estimate of $929.1 million. The Columbus, Ohio-based firm reported adjusted profit for the quarter of $9.65 per share, versus analysts' expectations of $9.03 per share. Even though the company raised its 2024 adjusted profit to be in the range of $40.20 to $40.50 per share, from its previous range of $39.90 to $40.40 apiece, its midpoint came 5 cents below estimates. Analysts, on average, expect a profit of $40.40 per share, for the year, according to LSEG data. Peer (NYSE: ) lowered its annual profit forecast last week, as it anticipates reduced demand for its products and services used in drug development and research."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/snap-misses-quarterly-revenue-estimates-as-competition-tightens-3550348,"By Akash Sriram (Reuters) -Snap forecast current-quarter results below expectations on Thursday as the Snapchat owner grapples with stiff competition from larger rivals for advertising dollars in an uncertain economy, sending its shares down 18% after-market. Its biggest competitors - Facebook and Instagram parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) and Bytedance's TikTok - far outrank it in terms of scale and established advertiser relationships. ""Light Q3 guidance doesn't help soothe their (investor) concerns. Snap faces tough competition from its much larger rival Meta, which investors rewarded for its strong ad business performance yesterday,"" said eMarketer principal analyst Jasmine Enberg. Meta forecast strong revenue for the third quarter and beat June-quarter sales estimates. Considered a more experimental advertising platform, Snap's revenue growth has come under pressure over the past few quarters as high interest rates prompt enterprise clients in certain sectors to tighten their marketing budgets. ""Brand-oriented advertising revenue declined 1% year-over-year, driven by particularly weak demand from certain consumer discretionary verticals including retail, technology, and entertainment,"" Snap said in its letter to shareholders. Its stock has been volatile over the past year, and was down about 24% as of Thursday's close after having fallen roughly 64% from a record high in October 2021. Snap has been investing heavily in its augmented reality platform, providing advertisers with branded AI-generated filters and lenses to attract audiences. The image-messaging platform's second-quarter revenue of $1.24 billion missed analysts' estimates of $1.25 billion, according to LSEG data. Image pinboard platform Pinterest (NYSE: ) also projected a muted third quarter on Wednesday, dashing investor hopes of a swift rebound in growth. Still, analysts have said Snap is set to benefit from a potential ban on TikTok in the United States as advertisers turn to Snapchat to grab the attention of younger users. Snap forecast a third-quarter revenue range with a midpoint of $1.355 billion, marginally below Wall Street estimates of $1.36 billion. It expects adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization between $70 million and $100 million in the third quarter, below expectations of $110.8 million. Daily active users (DAU) of Snapchat grew to 432 million at the end of June, beating estimates of 431.2 million. The Santa Monica, California-based company expects its DAU to reach 441 million in the third quarter."

The options-based , which has been largely subdued with an average reading of 13.96 so far this year, has perked up in recent weeks as investors have grown increasingly apprehensive about the outlook for corporate earnings and economic growth. The concerns, which have pulled the down about 4% from its July 16 record closing high of 5,667.2, have also spurred a jump in trading in VIX options. The index is up 14% year-to-date.

https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/canadas-capital-gains-tax-target-falls-short-by-c2-billion-says-budget-officer-3550397,"OTTAWA (Reuters) - Canadian federal government's target for a bump in its controversial capital gains tax over the next five years will fall short by a tenth, according to an analysis released on Thursday by the parliamentary budget officer. Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland revealed a new tax on wealthy individuals in her budget in April which would bring in C$19.4 billion ($13.99 billion) over four years. This windfall is expected to fund a bulk of the federal government's ambitious housing plan, a lack of which is partly responsible for shrinking Prime Minister Justin Trudeau's voter base and drop in approval ratings. ""The Parliamentary Budget Officer estimates an increase of $17.4 billion in income tax revenues from 2024-25 to 2028-29,"" the budget officer said in an estimate. Out of this, C$5.7 billion would be through personal income tax and C$11.6 billion would be through corporate incomes tax, it said. This is C$2 billion less than projected by the finance ministry. Freeland had said in April that only 0.13% of Canadians with an average income of C$1.4 million were expected to pay more personal income tax on their capital gains in any given year. But despite her assurances, the new tax was heavily criticized by individuals and businesses. ($1 = 1.3870 Canadian dollars)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed-to-cut-in-september-december-macquarie-says-amid-fresh-recession-jitters-3550204,"Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve is widely expected to deliver its first rate cut next month and followed it up by cutting again in December to ensure the economy remains on track for a soft landing just as fears of a recession resurface. ""Fed rate cuts will start in September, and continue in December,"" Macquarie said in a Thursday note. Expectations for a September rate cut were given another boost on Wednesday after Powell signaled that a rate cut was on the table for September should incoming data provide further confidence of progress on inflation. ""Powell noted that a rate cut 'could be' on the table in September, albeit,"" Macquarie said, ""subject to 'the totality of the data support[ing] such an outcome' - specifically 'inflation, employment, and the balance of risks'"", Macquarie added. Despite the path toward a first rate cut drawing closer, fears of a U.S. recession were front and center on Thursday after data showed further weakening in U.S. manufacturing activity and climb in initial jobless claims. Initial jobless claims increased to 249,000 for the week ended in Jul. 27, higher than expected, while the ISM manufacturing index for July came in at 46.8, below the 48.2 forecast. The weakness in manufacturing activity appears to be of particularly concern, Jefferies noted Thursday, as it marked the ""16-month streak of sub-50 readings that extended from November 2022 through March 2024."" This is the ""longest streak of contraction since August 2000-January 2002 (18 months), notably exceeding the decline surrounding the Great Financial Crisis,"" it added. While rate cuts should ""spark a rebound in private sector demand for capex investment,"" Jefferies says, this demand could be ""soft if the cuts are a response to weakness in the economy."" Powell on Wednesday didn't appear too concerned about a downturn in the economy, noting that the recent slowdown has been gradual rather than rapid. The Fed chief also said, however, that if the gradual pace of the slowdown were to accelerate, then the Fed would be prepared to act. ""We have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness,"" Powell added. ""That's not what we're seeing."" The weaker round of data comes just a day ahead of the report for July that economist estimate could show further slowing in the U.S. jobs market. Following the downward revisions to the May and June payroll gains, some continue to expect more of the same in Friday's report that will likely stoke further worries about the pace of slowing in the labor market. ""We expect downward revisions to prior months, the composition of which poses risks to the outlook for July,"" UBS said in a recent note."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-fdic-sexual-harassment-prevention-deficient-watchdog-says-3549704,"By Douglas Gillison (Reuters) -Efforts to prevent sexual harassment at the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, a top banking regulator, remain deficient despite promises in recent years to address the persistent problem, the agency's Office of Inspector General said in a report released Thursday. FDIC Chairman Martin Gruenberg agreed to step down in May after a scathing independent probe found pervasive instances of sexual harassment and racial discrimination at the agency, where he has held top positions for much of the past 20 years. The report released Thursday indicated prevention in recent years had not been an agency priority under leadership across administrations of both major parties. The FDIC, which is charged with helping ensure the stability of the nation's $24 trillion banking system, has neither shown commitment to preventing sexual harassment nor implemented an effective prevention program with the means to document and address allegations, the inspector general's office said in a statement. ""This occurred because the FDIC has not sustained many program improvements that were initiated as a result of our prior 2020 evaluation,"" the statement said. Gruenberg remains in office while the U.S. Senate considers President Joe Biden's nominee to replace him, Christy Goldsmith Romero, currently a member of the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As a result of its latest findings, the inspector general's office issued 24 recommendations, with which the FDIC has concurred and pledged to address by the end of March 2025, according to the inspector general's office. An FDIC spokesperson told Reuters the agency was committed to preventing sexual harassment. ""We agree with all of the recommendations in the report and are making substantial progress to address them,"" the spokesperson said. In a response attached to the report, FDIC Chief Operating Office Daniel Bendler said Gruenberg and senior agency executives had ""no higher priority"" than ensuring that all people at the agency felt ""safe, valued and respected."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/columnare-401k-matching-contributions-all-they-are-cracked-up-to-be-3549722,"By Mark Miller (Reuters) - When you are saving for retirement in a 401(k) account, the standard advice is to put aside enough to capture your employer’s matching contribution. That makes sense, since the contribution represents a risk-free 100% return on every dollar you save. The match is intended to be an incentive that encourages saving - but recent research shows there are better ways to get people to sock away their money. In many cases, the current structure of matching programs actually contributes to pay inequity - and they are not the most powerful incentives available to employers. “When we first created an employer match, we thought that was the carrot - the incentive that would get people to participate,” said Fiona Greig, global head of investor research and policy at Vanguard and co-author of a recent research brief on matching contributions. “But now we have a much heavier hammer.” That hammer, she said, includes the rise of plan features like automatic enrollment, auto escalation of contribution rates and higher initial default contribution rates. “These are the things that, without opening your eyes or engaging in any way, cause people to participate and save more over time,” she added. Matching contributions are a big, expensive feature of the 401(k) system. Vanguard notes federal government data showing that employers contributed $212 billion to defined contribution retirement plans in 2021 - about 58% of all dollars in the accounts. Vanguard, one of the nation’s largest administrators of 401(k) plans, evaluated more than 1,300 large retirement plans that the firm administers. The research does not conclude that employers should stop matching employee contributions - far from it. But it did find that employee saving rates do not vary much across plans with different levels of employer matches. More concerning is the finding that employer contributions exacerbate pay inequity. The contributions are highly concentrated, with 44% of dollars accruing to the top 20% of earners. “Higher-income people tend to participate more, and they also tend to contribute more,” said Greig. Indeed, a study by the Center for Retirement Research found that 59% of the tax deferral feature of 401(k) plans benefited the top fifth of earners, compared with just 3.7% for the bottom 40% of earners. The upshot is that employees who do not take full advantage of their employer match effectively get paid less than their peers, who save more, for a variety of reasons. That gap spills over into a broader problem with inequity in retirement security. The U.S. has persistent disparities in savings by race and ethnicity, with Black households holding only 14% as much as white households, and Hispanic households just 20% compared with white households. NEEDED: A BROADER EQUITY MENU There are plenty of opportunities to improve the equity of retirement security in the U.S. outside of the current features of 401(k)s. I would start with an across-the-board expansion of Social Security benefits, with extra bumps for low- and middle-income workers who have the least ability to save for retirement. Improved access to workplace saving plans also could help greatly. Only about half of private-sector U.S. workers are covered by an employer retirement saving plan at any given time - and that figure has not budged much over the years. The lost opportunity to save at the workplace translates into far too many people retiring only on Social Security. Seventeen U.S. states have moved to plug the gap with “auto-IRA” plans that mandate employers who do not offer their own 401(k)s to enroll workers in a government-sponsored plan. Eight of those states - including California, Illinois and Maryland - have launched their savings programs, and some policymakers hope to see the idea expanded nationally. Others have advocated what amounts to a national 401(k) plan featuring a government matching contribution for anyone lacking workplace coverage. Vanguard’s brief points to opportunities to reform the matching-contribution system to make it more equitable. The most common match programs use percentages - for example, 50% of an employee's contributions up to 6% of pay. Some plans contribute regardless of what the employee does. And some have employer contributions up to a dollar cap - for example, a 10% match on 6% of pay but capped at $6,000. But the researchers found little difference in employee contribution rates across various formulas. Other 401(k) plan features do seem to be leading to improved investor behavior. Vanguard’s latest annual report on workplace plan trends found a record-high share of plans offering automatic enrollment, rising employee participation rates and record-high rates of deferral into retirement accounts. And Vanguard is not suggesting that employer matches should be retired - rather, changes should be made that could make the matches more equitable. “These are big dollars being spent, and we think there are some ways that employers can evaluate their plans to make them more equitable and cost-effective.” Plans that pair auto-enrollment with a dollar cap scored highest for equitable treatment of employees, Vanguard found. “Auto-enrollment causes everyone to benefit from the employer match, rather than leaving people to make the choice to not participate at all,” said Greig. “And that is really important in terms of equity.” The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/central-banks-are-turning-the-ship-but-their-path-is-unclear-3550044,"By Howard Schneider and David Milliken WASHINGTON/LONDON (Reuters) - Decisions by major central banks this week brought the end of pandemic-era monetary policy into closer view, but also highlighted how long the road back to ""normal"" will be as officials now probe for the endpoint of interest rate cuts and manage the wind-down of massive balance sheets. The Bank of England on Thursday cut its policy rate to 5.00% from 5.25%, joining the European Central Bank, Bank of Canada and others in reducing the tight monetary policy put in place to battle the inflation that raced across much of the world as the COVID-19 pandemic snarled supply chains even as it unleashed a wave of government spending and consumer demand. That inflation wave has now largely subsided and interest rates will be falling from here, with the world's major player, the U.S. Federal Reserve, laying the groundwork this week for its first rate cut in September. In a policy statement on Wednesday the Fed said it was as concerned about protecting the job market as it was about inflation that is now just about half a percentage point above its 2% target. Fed Chair Jerome Powell then suggested in a press conference that rate cuts could begin in September if the economy follows its expected course. ""If we were to see inflation moving down ... more or less in line with expectations, growth remains reasonably strong, and the labor market remains consistent with current conditions, then I think a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting,"" he said. 'BE CAREFUL' A common exit from inflation-fighting and high interest rates was in doubt only a few months ago when U.S. inflation legged unexpectedly higher to start the year, delaying a Fed pivot toward lower borrowing costs that had been expected to start in June. Yet that doesn't mean the Fed, BoE, BoC and ECB all know the path ahead - and in particular how fast or how far rate cuts may proceed. That debate is in full swing at the ECB, for instance, with President Christine Lagarde saying the central bank's September meeting was ""wide open"" and a number of policymakers hinting since then at more cuts coming if data behaves as expected. In Canada, meanwhile, the BoC has shifted gears to supporting an economy that has been underperforming recently. A third straight rate cut is now expected in September. And in the U.S., rate futures markets have begun pricing in a not-dismissable probability that conditions will soften enough over the seven weeks to the Fed's next meeting to warrant a half-percentage-point rate cut, rather than just a quarter-percentage-point move. The post-pandemic world, many economists, feel, may be marked by higher trend inflation, less integrated global markets, and a massive government debt hangover. Those are all reasons why central banks may need to keep rates higher than through the decade before the pandemic - also leaving less scope to cut. BoE Governor Andrew Bailey nodded to just that possibility after UK central bank officials narrowly approved a first rate cut by the slimmest of margins. In a statement alongside the decision, Bailey said: ""We need to make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much."" BOJ'S OWN DIRECTION The Bank of Japan is on the same journey from the opposite direction, raising rates this week in a sign of confidence that its unique experiment in aggressive central banking, with negative interest rates and direct efforts to manage yields on long-term government bonds, has pulled the country away from the risk of stagnation and falling wages and prices. Yet the end is the same: Determining what ""normal"" economics looks like after a period when many long-held truths appeared to break. Powell on Wednesday noted that the 0.7 percentage point rise in the U.S. unemployment rate since last summer was close to triggering a widely touted rule of thumb - the Sahm Rule - that would indicate the country is already in recession. U.S. Treasury yields - with benchmark shorter-dated maturities yielding more than longer-dated ones for more than two years now - have been flashing a recession warning as well. Yet growth and consumer spending are strong, the jobless rate, at 4.1%, is low by historical standards, and there are few signs of widespread stress. Noting all that, Powell said he thought the risk of a downturn right now was low. ""This pandemic era has been one in which so many apparent rules have been flouted, like the inverted yield curve, for starters. So many, many pieces of received wisdom just haven't worked,"" Powell said. That is why the first rate cut will only be the start of a journey as central bankers look to shape their still-bloated balance sheets and interest rate policies for realities they don't fully understand. ""Policy rates would move down from here, but I don't want to try to give specific forward guidance about when that might be, the pace at which it might happen, because I think that's really going to depend on the economy,"" Powell said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/lilly-ceo-says-weightloss-drug-shortage-to-end-very-soon-bloomberg-news-reports-3550043,"(Reuters) - U.S. drugmaker Eli Lilly (NYSE: ) expects its blockbuster weight-loss drug to officially come out of shortage in the United States in coming days, Bloomberg News reported on Thursday, citing an interview with the company's CEO, David Ricks. Lilly's drug, tirzepatide, sold as Mounjaro for diabetes and Zepbound for weight management, will cease to be in shortage ""very soon,"" CEO David Ricks said in an interview with Bloomberg in Paris. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's website lists some doses of Mounjaro and Zepbound as being in limited supply. Mounjaro has been on the FDA's shortage list since late 2022. The health regulator said it has no further comments to provide beyond what is available on its drug shortages list, while Lilly did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The agency generally assesses whether all backorders for the drug have been filled and supply is meeting or exceeding demand before removing a drug from its shortage list. Lilly said in April that it expects supply of Zepbound to remain ""quite tight"" in the near and midterm as it ramps up capacity. Eli Lilly and Danish rival Novo Nordisk (NYSE: ) are racing to increase production in a weight-loss drug market estimated to reach about $150 billion by early 2030s. Both the companies' obesity treatments belong to a class of drugs originally developed for diabetes known as GLP-1 agonists. GLP-1 drugs have been shown to help patients lose on average as much as 20% of their weight, fueling unparalleled demand. Novo makes the diabetes drug Ozempic and its weight-loss equivalent Wegovy. Separately, Lilly reported earlier on Thursday that Zepbound helped reduce the risk of hospitalization, death and other outcomes for obese adults with a common type of heart failure."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-30year-mortgage-slides-to-lowest-since-february-freddie-mac-says-3550012,"By Makailah Gause NEW YORK (Reuters) - The average rate on the popular U.S. 30-year mortgage rate fell to 6.73% this week, its lowest level since February as the bond market reacted to signs of cooling inflation. The 30-year fixed-rate mortgage was 5 basis points lower than a week earlier when it averaged 6.78%, mortgage finance giant Freddie Mac said on Thursday. It averaged 6.90% during the same period a year ago. ""Apprehension in consumer confidence may prevent an immediate uptick as affordability challenges remain top of mind,"" Chief Economist Sam Khater said in a statement. But, he said, data showing a moderation in home price growth and increasing housing inventory are positive signs for prospective home buyers. House prices increased 5.7% year-on-year in May, the smallest annual increase in 10 months as still-high mortgage rates then kept a lid on demand, the Federal Housing Finance Agency said Tuesday. More recently, though, pending home sales surged 4.8% in June from a month earlier, helped by the recent increase in homes for sale, the National Association of Realtors said on Wednesday. Still, even with home loan rates now more than 1 percentage point below their peak levels from last year, mortgage application volumes remain subdued. ""Many borrowers may be hoping and waiting for mortgage rates to decline even further, which is what we expect to happen once the Federal Reserve begins to cut short-term rates,"" Mortgage Bankers Association Chief Executive Bob Broeksmit said in a statement. If inflation continues to cool, the Fed could cut interest rates as soon as September, Chair Jerome Powell said Wednesday."
https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/canadian-union-unifor-calls-for-strict-tariffs-on-imported-chinese-evs-components-3549922,"By Divya Rajagopal TORONTO (Reuters) - Canadian labour union Unifor called on the federal government on Thursday to impose tariffs on all Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs), EV batteries and other components, aligning it with some of the measures already proposed by the United States. In July, Canada began a public consultation process as it weighs imposing tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles, following similar moves by the United States and European Union. The Canadian government has said it sees ""a risk that China's unfair support for the EV sector, if left unchecked, could lead to an exponential surge of imports that will adversely affect planned EV investments and the transformation of Canada's automotive sector."" The public consultation process is set to end this week. ""The United States and the European Union have responded proactively to the threat posed by unfair imports and now it's time for Canada to do the same,"" Unifor, Canada's largest union representing private-sector workers, said on Thursday. Unifor has demanded that Ottawa impose a surtax above the existing tariff rates of 100% on Chinese-made electric vehicles, and a surtax of 25% on batteries, as well as tariffs on electric motors and battery cell materials. Even as Canada examines possible tariffs, Chinese automaker BYD (SZ: ), one of the world's biggest EV manufacturers, recently met with the Canadian government to discuss the potential application of tariffs on EVs, and its plans to begin selling passenger EVs in Canada."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/leisure-vehicle-makers-feel-the-heat-this-summer-as-bigticket-spending-cools-3549908,"By Savyata Mishra (Reuters) - Makers of ATVs, boats and other recreational vehicles are staring at a bleak summer as caution around big-ticket purchases amid high interest rates has dashed hopes of a demand recovery for big manufacturers of leisure products. In the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, consumers with money to spend took advantage of low rates to buy goods many refer to as ""adult toys"" - motorcycles, boats, RVs and other vehicles that cost a lot and are often financed through loans. The shine came off some of the companies when people returned to international travel, but now with consumer spending slipping, makers of the discretionary items are feeling the pain. Retail sales in the recreational vehicle industry for June and July were slightly worse than what dealers experienced in May, D.A. Davidson analyst Brandon Rolle said. Late last month, shares of motorboats maker Brunswick (NYSE: ) and snowmobiles manufacturer Polaris (NYSE: ) slumped after they slashed annual forecasts after reporting a drop in second-quarter sales and profit. ""Consumers are either maxed out or banks are hesitant to lend at these elevated levels. All these factors have negatively impacted the industry retail environment and resulted in a need to lower inventory of dealerships,"" Polaris CEO Mike Speetzen said on a post-earnings call. Brunswick expects U.S. powerboat sales to a decline of around 10% after posting a 15% drop in sales during the second quarter, normally its peak selling season. Several brokerages have lowered their price targets on Brunswick and Polaris after their results. (NYSE: ) also trimmed its full-year forecast and said it expects weakness to continue into 2025 as dealers are wary of excess inventory. The Canadian powersports firm BRP (NASDAQ: ), which reported results in May, also pruned its annual outlook, despite its first-quarter profit beating estimates. ""With no signs of a seasonal uptick in demand so far, 2024 will almost certainly be a lost year and prospects for 2025 are now coming into question,"" Roth MKM analyst Scott Stember said about Brunswick. Most companies took steps to reduce inventory. Harley-Davidson (NYSE: ) cut dealer inventories by 30% and said it hopes retail and wholesale inventory will be balanced by the end of the year. ""It's not just about the fact that financing the purchase is more expensive overall, that budget suppression ...and interest rates on other finance purchases, not to mention the fact that there's a confidence issue there,"" Brunswick CEO David Foulkes said. So far this year, Polaris, Brunswick and Thor stocks have lost between 12% and 16% of their value. Harley-Davidson was up 2% and BRP 4%."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/german-finance-ministry-advisory-board-doubtful-about-efforts-to-reduce-budget-gap-3549705,"By Maria Martinez BERLIN (Reuters) -The advisory board to the German Finance Ministry sees the three options under consideration to reduce a 17 billion euro ($18 billion) budget shortfall as problematic, according to a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday. The German cabinet passed its 2025 budget in July after months of political wrangling. German Finance Minister Christian Lindner told a news conference that the government was looking at innovative ways to reduce the shortfall. The options under scrutiny are using extra funds from state bank KfW, as well as converting the grants of Germany's national rail operator Deutsche Bahn and the country's highway company into loans. The advisory board to the ministry expressed doubts about these options, arguing that they could put at risk the constitutionally enshrined debt brake. Lindner said, when presenting the budget, the constitutionality of these options was being studied. The government is trying to avoid the chaos of November 2023, when a court ruling blew a 60-billion-euro hole in the public finances and threw the government's financing framework into turmoil. Negotiations on the financing of the 2025 federal budget must therefore continue in the German coalition. Finance ministry sources said that suspending the debt brake, which restricts public borrowing to 0.35% of gross domestic product, is not an option ""constitutionally or economically.""

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/uk-firms-scale-back-expected-wage-growth-boe-survey-shows-3549679,"LONDON (Reuters) - British businesses' expectations for wage growth in the next 12 months cooled slightly in July, according to a survey that could help ease the concerns of Bank of England policymakers who are tasked with keeping inflation on target. Expectations for wage growth over the coming year in the BoE's Decision Maker Panel survey fell to 4.1% in the three months to July from 4.2% in the three months June, while on a single-month basis, the measure ticked up slightly to 4.1% from 4.0%. Rob Wood, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said easing inflation and recruitment difficulties will help slow wages more decisively in the second half of the year. ""Inflation, wage growth, inflation expectations, recruitment difficulties and employment growth have all eased since the MPC raised rates to their peak, suggesting tight monetary policy is working,"" Wood said. ""But there are also enough signals for us to expect wage growth and inflation to linger above target consistent rates for longer than the MPC expects."" On Thursday, the BoE cut interest rates to 5%, down from a 16-year high of 5.25%. It was the first time the central bank cut rates since March 2020, the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, but Governor Andrew Bailey said the BoE was not committing to a series of quick reductions in borrowing costs. Firms surveyed by the BoE expected to raise their own selling prices in the year ahead by less than in the previous survey."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/tech-giants-faced-major-market-cap-drop-in-july-on-earnings-worries-3549663,"(Reuters) - Global mega tech companies' market capitalisation dropped sharply in July, in response to disappointing quarterly results and concerns over high valuations, prompting investors to shift their focus away from the AI sector. In the first half of 2024, investors pushed tech stocks higher on expectations that AI advancements would boost earnings. But the second-quarter earnings reports from tech companies have raised concerns that investment in AI infrastructure has led to ballooning costs with only modest gains. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) reported revenue that fell short of analysts' expectations, while Tesla (NASDAQ: ) reported its lowest profit margin in more than five years. Additionally, Google's parent company, Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), experienced a slowdown in advertising sales at YouTube, raising concerns about Alphabet's ability to expand its margins. Microsoft and Alphabet's market capitalisations fell by about 6% to $3.1 trillion and $2.1 trillion, respectively, at the end of July, based on LSEG data. Slowing profits among its major customers dampened growth expectations for chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ: ), leading to a 5.2% reduction in its market cap to $2.8 trillion. This downturn also impacted its Taiwanese production partner TSMC, the world's largest third-party microchip foundry, which experienced a 4.3% decrease in market cap to $737.8 billion at the end of July. Bucking the trend, Apple (NASDAQ: )'s market cap surged 5.4% to $3.4 trillion at the end of July, fuelled by optimism that its new AI initiative, Apple Intelligence, would boost sales and encourage customers to upgrade their devices to utilize the new technology. But then Nvidia added about $330 billion in stock market value on Wednesday, a record one-day gain for any company on Wall Street after Microsoft and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) reignited the AI rally. Outside the tech sector, drug maker Eli Lilly (NYSE: )'s market capitalisation fell 11.2% to $764.3 billion, amid concerns about its lead in the anti-obesity market being challenged by a promising experimental pill from rival Roche. Despite weak results, Tesla's market cap increased by 17.2% to $740.1 billion, buoyed by optimism about its future growth prospects. Morgan Stanley named Tesla the most valuable automaker its ""top pick"" in the U.S. automotive industry, replacing Ford (NYSE: ) and predicted that Tesla's energy business could eventually surpass its auto business in value."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-england-cuts-rates-from-16year-high-careful-on-future-moves-3548419,"By David Milliken, Andy Bruce and Suban Abdulla LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England cut interest rates from a 16-year high on Thursday after a tight vote by its policymakers who were split over whether inflation pressures had eased sufficiently. Governor Andrew Bailey led the 5-4 decision to reduce rates by a quarter-point to 5% and he said the BoE would move cautiously going forward. It was the central bank's first cut since March 2020, at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic, giving Britain's new government a boost as it seeks to speed up the pace of economic growth. But Bailey stressed the BoE was not committing to a series of quick reductions in borrowing costs. ""We need to make sure make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,"" he said in a statement. Most economists polled by Reuters had expected a cut while financial markets had seen just over a 60% chance. Sterling slipped to its lowest against the U.S. dollar since early July and bond yields also fell slightly after the BoE's announcement with the yield on 10-year gilts touching its lowest since March. Bailey insisted the BoE would take its decisions on rates ""from meeting to meeting"" but investors were betting on another rate cut this year with the chance of a move at its next meeting in September seen as a roughly 55% probability. ""The Bank of England is staying tight-lipped on when it expects to cut rates again,"" ING economist James Smith said. ""But we think better news on services inflation and wage growth can unlock one, or more likely two rate cuts by year-end."" Borrowing costs had been on hold for almost a full year - the longest period they have been left unchanged at the peak of a BoE tightening cycle since 2001. In June, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold. Minutes of the August meeting showed the decision to cut them was ""finely balanced"" for some members. None of the policymakers whose votes changed the balance - Bailey and Deputy Governors Sarah Breeden and new MPC member Clare Lombardelli - had spoken publicly about monetary policy since June. Speaking opportunities had been limited by the July 4 election which brought the Labour Party to power. The BoE said policymakers had been briefed on this week's announcements of big public-sector pay increases and on fiscal policy, but their impact would only be incorporated into the BoE's forecasts after the Oct. 30 budget. Finance minister Rachel Reeves welcomed the rate cut but said millions of families still faced higher mortgage rates and she reiterated her plan to ""fix the foundations of our economy after years of low growth."" British consumer price inflation returned to the BoE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, down from a 41-year high of 11.1% struck in October 2022. This leaves British inflation lower than in the euro zone - where the European Central Bank cut rates in June - and the United States, where on Wednesday the Federal Reserve opened the door to a September cut. INFLATION TO RISE The BoE expects headline inflation to rise to 2.75% in the final quarter of 2024 as the effect of steep falls in energy prices fades, before returning to its 2% target in early 2026 and later sinking below. The long time lags for interest rates to affect inflation mean the BoE is more focused on what it sees as medium-term drivers of inflation: services prices, wage growth and tightness in the labour market. The BoE linked June's strong services inflation to ""volatile components"" and regulated prices that were influenced by high headline CPI earlier in the year. Wage growth at nearly 6% is almost double the rate the BoE views as consistent with 2% inflation but is slowing in line with the central bank's expectations. The BoE now thinks Britain's economy will expand by around 1.25% this year, up from a previous forecast of 0.5%, after stronger-than-expected growth earlier this year. Based on International Monetary Fund forecasts, that would be stronger growth than in France, Italy and Germany. Surveys of businesses published earlier on Thursday suggested growth in Britain last month was stronger than in much of the euro zone and Asia. The BoE said unemployment will rise slightly, reducing upward pressure on inflation. However, it acknowledged the risk that price pressures might prove more persistent and keep inflation above target for longer than its main forecast. Next month the BoE must decide whether it continues the annual 100 billion-pound pace of reductions in its bond holdings. The BoE repeated its view that these sales had a limited impact on the gilt market and said the high level of interest rates would allow it to fine-tune monetary conditions if it proved greater in future."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-construction-spending-extends-decline-in-june-3549435,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. construction spending unexpectedly fell in June and the prior month's data was revised lower as higher mortgage rates weighed on single-family homebuilding. The Commerce Department's Census Bureau said on Thursday that construction spending dropped 0.3% after a downwardly revised 0.4% decline in May. Economists polled by Reuters had forecast construction spending rising 0.2% after a previously reported 0.1% dip in May. Construction spending advanced 6.2% year-on-year in June. Spending on private construction projects fell 0.3% in June after dropping 0.4% in the prior month. Investment in residential construction dropped 0.3% after falling 0.7% in May. Outlays on new single-family construction projects decreased 1.2%. Spending on multi-family housing gained 0.1%. Mortgage rates surged in the spring, depressing homebuilding and sales. Mortgage rates have since fallen and could decline further after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday kept its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, where it has been since last July, but opened the door to reducing borrowing costs as soon as its next meeting in September. Rising housing inventory, with new single-family housing supply in June hitting the highest level since early 2008, could limit any rebound in new construction. Residential investment, which includes homebuilding and house sales, contracted in the second quarter after double-digit growth in the January-March quarter. In June, spending on private non-residential structures like factories dipped 0.1%. Investment in public construction projects fell 0.4% after slipping 0.2% in May. State and local government spending was unchanged and outlays on federal government projects declined 5.4%."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/canada-cuts-boj-and-russia-hike-as-other-cenbanks-dither-in-july-3549351,"By Rodrigo Campos and Sumanta Sen NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan hiked its key interest rate for just the second time since 2007 and the Bank of Canada cut rates for the second month in a row, while the U.S. Federal Reserve stayed put in July. Among emerging economies, July saw Russia's central bank hike its benchmark rate by 200 basis points (bps) to the highest level in over two years, while Colombia's 50 bps cut was the largest last month, with China and Hungary also lowering rates. Five of the central banks overseeing the 10 most heavily traded currencies held meetings in July, with Japan hiking rates to 0.25% and Canada easing another 25 bps to reach 4.5%. The Bank of England cut interest rates on Thursday in a narrow vote by 25 bps to 5% - the first move of the August tally. The U.S. Fed, the European Central Bank, and the Reserve Bank of New Zealand held rates steady in July, with the Fed and RBNZ leaving the door open to rate cuts in the near future, data depending. This year through July, developed economies posted a total of 35 bps in hikes, all out of Japan, while six rate cuts elsewhere have amounted for 150 bps in policy easing. A rate cut of at least 25 bps is fully priced in for the Fed's September meeting after Chair Jerome Powell said it could come as early as next month, with the Fed focusing equally on lowering inflation and its full employment mandate. ""With the likely timing and size of the first (Fed) cut well communicated, the tougher question becomes the pace of cuts thereafter,"" said JPMorgan's Michael Feroli in a client note. ""So the shift in risk balance should clear the way not only for the first ease but potentially a long series of eases."" Thirteen out of the Reuters sample of 18 central banks in developing economies held rate-setting meetings in July, with Colombia, Hungary, and China combining for a total of 85 bps in cuts. Only Russia hiked and the other nine left rates unchanged. Chile was among those staying put, opting not to cut rates for the first meeting in nine. ""We see risks to our near-term policy rate path as skewed toward the possibility of just one, rather than two, cuts over the rest of the year,"" said Goldman Sachs' Sergio Armella in a note. The latest moves in emerging markets took the tally of cuts since the start of the year to 1,260 bps across 26 moves. Total hikes over the same period stood at 975 bps in four actions, with Russia joining previous hikers Turkey and Indonesia."

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ethiopian-local-authorities-crack-down-on-price-hikes-after-currency-float-3549343,"ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - At least two Ethiopian local governments have ordered the closure of dozens of businesses found hiking prices of basic commodities after the central bank floated the national currency, officials said on Thursday. The Ethiopian birr weakened by 28% against the dollar this week after the central bank adopted a market-determined foreign exchange rate to secure a new International Monetary Fund lending programme and to put debt restructuring back on track. ""The businesses were caught making unreasonable price increases mostly on food items ... The stocks were imported before the new exchange rate,"" said Sewnet Ayele, a spokesperson for the Addis Ababa City Trade Bureau. Some 71 businesses have been affected by the closure order, Sewnet said. In Oromiya region, another 19 businesses were closed and three people detained, said Meseret Assefa, head of the Trade Bureau of Oromiya. ""Those whose business are closed were the ones who increased prices on items just immediately after the (exchange rate) announcement,"" Meseret said. The main commodity whose price has gone up is cooking oil, which is selling at 25%, or 300 birrs, more, said a trader in Addis Ababa, who did not wish to be named. Other commodities whose prices have gone up by a smaller margin include rice, said the trader. Although the removal of foreign exchange trading restrictions helped Ethiopia to clinch the IMF deal and funding from other creditors like the World Bank, some Ethiopian analysts fear it will cause price hikes that hit the poor hardest. The government and its development partners say the liberalisation will help the private sector make a bigger contribution to the economy and boost long-term growth."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/major-central-banks-rate-cuts-gather-pace-3549326,"By Naomi Rovnick and Alun John LONDON (Reuters) - The global rate cut cycle is picking up steam, with half of developed markets' central banks having begun easing, and the U.S. Federal Reserve setting up a move in September. Investors are also watching the Bank of Japan - which is going the other way after it raised interest rates on Wednesday to their highest in 15 years. Here's where leading central banks stand and what they are expected to do next: 1/ SWITZERLAND The Swiss National Bank in March implemented the first rate cut among developed market economies of this cycle and lowered borrowing costs again to 1.25% in June. It is expected to cut again in September. Swiss inflation has moderated to 1.3% year-on-year, firmly within the SNB's target range. 2/ CANADA Traders widely expect more rate cuts from the Bank of Canada, which is shifting gear from suppressing inflation, to safeguarding the economy and has lowered borrowing costs by half a percentage point to 4.5% since June. Population growth has helped Canada avoid a recession, but driven unemployment higher, while previous rate hikes have dampened consumer spending and housing demand. 3/ SWEDEN Sweden's Riksbank ended a long era of monetary tightening in May, with its first rate cut of this cycle and stands ready to cut two or three times more after inflation cooled off and the economy contracted sharply. Swedish interest rates stand at 3.75%, looking steep compared to the 1.3% consumer prices rose by in June from a year earlier, on the EU harmonised measure. 4/ EURO ZONE The European Central Bank kept rates unchanged at 3.75% last month, following a cut in June, and resisted discussing its next move. Overall, euro zone inflation has dropped close to the ECB's target. But service sector price pressures have kept some of its policymakers cautious. Money markets price a roughly 70% chance of another rate cut in September. 5/ BRITAIN The Bank of England cut interest rates from a 16-year high on Thursday after a narrow vote in favour from policymakers divided over whether inflation pressures had eased sufficiently. The cut was the first since March 2020. Governor Andrew Bailey - who led the 5-4 decision to lower rates by a quarter-point to 5% - said the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee would move cautiously going forward. 6/ UNITED STATES Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday put the U.S. central bank on course for its first cut of this cycle in September, following a reassuring step down in U.S. inflation. The Fed is looking towards its first 25 bps cut after holding rates in the 5.25% to 5.5% range for a year as it shifts its focus to the risks of the economy weakening and unemployment rising. Money markets are pricing 46 bps of cuts by November and almost 71 bps by December. 7/ NEW ZEALAND The Reserve Bank of New Zealand held its cash rate steady at 5.5% at its July meeting, but opened the door to possible easing if inflation slows. Traders see the RBNZ most likely staying on hold at its August 14 meeting then cutting rates in October. 8/ NORWAY Norway's annual core inflation, which strips out energy prices and taxes, fell faster than expected to 3.6% in June. That remains uncomfortably high for the Norges Bank, which anticipates holding rates at their 16-year high of 4.50% until early 2025, although futures markets price a roughly 50% chance of a move in December. 9/ AUSTRALIA Lower-than-expected core inflation data released Wednesday has changed the picture for the Reserve Bank of Australia. Markets had seen an outside chance of a rate hike at the RBA's Aug. 5-6 policy meeting, but that's now off the table. Traders see a 70% chance they will cut rates from their current 12-year high by year-end instead. 10/ JAPAN The Bank of Japan is the outlier. The standout dove until last year, the BOJ, on Wednesday raised its key policy rate to 0.25% from 0-0.1%, levels unseen in 15 years, and unveiled a detailed plan to slow its massive bond buying programme. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda did not rule out another hike this year and stressed the bank's readiness to keep raising borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy. That helped push the dollar below 150 yen for the first time since March."

Below are actions taken by some shipping companies (in alphabetical order): CMA CGM The French shipping group has suspended most Red Sea voyages but is still sending some cargoes on a case by case basis when French navy escorts are possible, Chairman and CEO Rodolphe Saade said in February. DIANA SHIPPING The company's vessels are avoiding the Suez Canal. ""Suez Canal transits are running about 40% below those seen during the first half of December last year. This is partially the result of several operators including ourselves avoiding the area,"" President Anastasios Margaronis said in February. DSV The world's third-largest freight forwarder DSV said on July 24 that higher freight volume boosted earnings in the second quarter. It also expects a positive impact from the disruptions in the second half of the year. EURONAV The Belgian oil tanker firm said in December it would avoid the Red Sea until further notice. EVERGREEN The Taiwanese container shipping line said in December its vessels on regional services to Red Sea ports would sail to safe waters nearby, while ships scheduled to pass through the Red Sea would be rerouted around Africa. FRONTLINE The Norway-based oil tanker group said in December its vessels would avoid the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aden. GRAM CAR CARRIERS The Norwegian auto carrier said in December its vessels were restricted from passing through the Red Sea. HAFNIA The Norwegian shipping firm said in January it had halted all ships heading towards or within the Bab al-Mandab Strait. HAPAG-LLOYD The German container shipping line decided in January to reroute its vessels around Africa until further notice. It said in June it did not expect the industry to resume sailing in the Red Sea even if a ceasefire between Hamas and Israel was reached immediately. It has also said the disruptions and global vessel oversupply would force it to cut expenses in 2024, including adapting sailings. HMM The South Korean container shipper in December ordered ships that would normally use the Suez Canal to reroute around Africa. HOEGH AUTOLINERS The Norwegian auto carrier said in December it would stop sailing via the Red Sea. In February, it said the disruptions were adversely impacting its capacity and volumes. KLAVENESS COMBINATION CARRIERS The Norway-based fleet operator said in January its vessels would avoid the Red Sea until the situation improves. KUEHNE + NAGEL The Swiss logistics group said in March it expected the impact from the disruptions to last into the coming quarters. It said on July 23 the impact on its business was ""minimal"", and it was ready for higher second-half demand after increased use of its Sea-Air Logistics service. MAERSK Maersk said on Aug. 1 it expected the disruptions to continue at least until the end of 2024, as it raised its full-year outlook again partly due to the crisis. The Danish group, which has suspended Red Sea traffic, said in July it was experiencing a cascading impact from disruptions in the region, with congestions to its entire ocean network. MSC Mediterranean Shipping Company (MSC) said in December its ships would not transit through the Suez Canal. NIPPON YUSEN Japan's biggest shipper by sales suspended navigation through the Red Sea for all its vessels, a spokesperson told Reuters in January. OCEAN NETWORK EXPRESS The joint venture between Japan's Kawasaki Kisen Kaisha, Mitsui O.S.K. Lines and Nippon Yusen said in December it would reroute vessels around the Cape of Good Hope or temporarily pause journeys and move to safe areas. OOCL The Hong Kong-headquartered container group said in December it had instructed vessels to either divert away from the Red Sea or suspend sailing. It also stopped accepting cargo to and from Israel until further notice. STAR BULK Greece-headquartered Star Bulk's CEO said in February it would halt sailings through the Red Sea after attacks on two of its ships. TAILWIND SHIPPING LINES The Lidl unit, which transports non-food goods for the discount supermarket chain and goods for third-party customers, said in December it was sailing around Africa for now. TORM The Danish oil tanker group in January paused all transits through the southern Red Sea for the time being. WALLENIUS WILHELMSEN The Norwegian shipping group said in December it would halt Red Sea transits until further notice."

The eight-year-old startup will court investors at a time when enthusiasm for AI remains high, boosting the fortunes of firms that supply the infrastructure critical to train chatbots. But Cerebras could face questions about the competitive threat from Nvidia, whose dominance in the AI market helped it join the elite $1 trillion club and briefly dethrone Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) as the world's most valuable company. The IPO will also be a major test about the appetite for AI-linked stocks. Concerns over excessive AI spending prompted some investors to rotate out of the technology sector and into value stocks over the last month. Cerebras has been backed by a number of high-profile investors, including the Abu Dhabi Growth Fund and Coatue Management.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/mobileye-slashes-annual-forecasts-on-sluggish-demand-shares-tank-3549295,"By Deborah Mary Sophia (Reuters) -Mobileye Global cut its annual revenue and profit forecasts on Thursday, slammed by volatile demand for its driver-assistance chips in China, even as it recovered from a sales slump brought on by a worldwide auto inventory glut. Shares of the Israel-based automotive tech company tumbled over 24% in early trading, putting it on track to lose more than $4 billion in market value if losses hold. Automakers worldwide had scaled back orders with their suppliers due to a pandemic-induced inventory glut. While inventories have now largely normalized, weak consumer demand has spurred production cuts at carmakers, translating into fewer orders for Mobileye's chips. A frail Chinese economy meant a cut in big-ticket spending by consumers in the country, prompting Chinese automakers to cut orders at Mobileye. China's car sales fell 2.9% in June, according to data from the China Passenger Car Association. ""China automotive is very, very volatile. It's very difficult to make an accurate forecast. This is why we took... what would be the worst case for 2024... Our guidance does not reflect our optimistic view. It reflects our worst-case view,"" CEO Amnon Shashua said in an earnings call. Mobileye now expects 2024 shipment volumes of its mass-market EyeQ chips to be between 28 million and 29 million, down from 31 million to 33 million projected earlier. Shipment forecasts for its more advanced SuperVision system, which investors have been focused on, were also cut to 110,000 to 130,000, from 175,000 to 195,000 previously. ""The narrative on Mobileye is more tied to SuperVision than macro. Winning SuperVision is a huge aspect and that's what the stock is trading on... More contracts were supposed to come in H2 and we're already in August, so some investors might be getting a little impatient,” RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan said.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ecbs-stournaras-raises-risk-of-too-low-inflation-platow-reports-3548776,"FRANKFURT (Reuters) - A weak euro zone economy may drag inflation below the European Central Bank's 2% target, ECB policymaker Yannis Stournaras said in an interview published on Thursday, reaffirming his expectation for two interest rate cuts this year. The ECB has faced too high inflation for nearly three years, to which it responded with a long streak of rate hikes that it only recently began to dial back. Stournaras, the head of the Bank of Greece and one of the doves on the ECB's Governing Council who favour lower rates, said growth was lower than the central bank expected and so could be inflation. ""The renewed signs of weak economic activity and the high level of uncertainty will very likely dampen inflation more than had been expected,"" he told German financial newsletter Platow Brief. ""This suggests that there is a risk of inflation falling below the 2% target in the medium term."" Euro zone inflation for July and growth for the second quarter came in slightly hotter than economists expected this weak but traders still expect the ECB to resume lowering borrowing costs in September or October at the latest as surveys point to slowing activity. Stournaras backed that expectation although he cautioned this would depend on incoming data, especially on wages, and the ECB's new economic projections published next month. ""I still expect two rate cuts this year if disinflation continues as expected,"" he said. ""We are on the right track. In addition, growth is weaker than expected, which also speaks in favour of interest rate cuts."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-england-cuts-rates-from-16year-high-3548508,"LONDON (Reuters) -The Bank of England cut interest rates from a 16-year high on Thursday after a narrow vote in favour from policymakers divided over whether inflation pressures had eased sufficiently, which initially dented the pound. Thursday's decision was in line with the forecast in a Reuters poll of economists but financial markets had only seen just over a 60% chance of a cut. Governor Andrew Bailey - who led the 5-4 decision to lower rates by a quarter-point to 5% - said the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee would move cautiously going forward. ""We need to make sure make sure inflation stays low, and be careful not to cut interest rates too quickly or by too much,"" he said in a statement alongside the decision. MARKET REACTION: STOCKS: The domestically focussed midcap index gained 0.3%%, having hit its highest in over two years. The blue chip index pared gains, trading unchanged on the day. FOREX: Sterling fell to a session low of $1.2752 immediately after the decision, before reversing some of those losses to trade at $1.2787, down 0.54% on the day. It also pared some of its losses against the euro, which was up 0.23% at 84.39 pence, off a session high of 84.57. BONDS: Benchmark 10-year gilt yields were last down 3.9 basis points on the day at 3.936%, unchanged compared to before the decision. Two-year gilt yields, which are more sensitive to shifts in monetary policy, were down 5 bps at 3.762%, around 15-month lows. COMMENTS: LAURA FOLL, UK EQUITIES MANAGER, JANUS HENDERSON, LONDON: “The market was struggling to price ahead this decision because of the absence of smoke signals from Threadneedle Street during the election campaign. But there was a growing consensus in the City over the past couple of days that a cut was coming. The Bank of England is still being cautious - it was a close decision and the message is clear – don't expect rate cuts at every meeting. But peak interest rates are, for now, behind us. And that might be sufficient to nudge consumers sitting on savings to stop postponing those big decisions on house moves, renovations and big-ticket spending."" HARRY RICHARDS, PORTFOLIO MANAGER, FIXED INCOME, JUPITER ASSET MANAGEMENT, LONDON: “The BoE is entirely justified in starting to cut rates now. The economy has evolved to such an extent that the level of extreme monetary policy was simply no longer required and, instead, dialling-back the degree of restrictiveness makes ample sense. In our view, the BOE should loosen policy much more aggressively as we move into 2025 so as to avoid doing irreparable harm to the labour market and risk sparking the hard landing concerns once more."" ""On the more positive side, the election result has delivered an air of relative political stability to the UK which we believe may entice international investors to look favourably upon UK fixed income markets. Importantly, however, the new government’s recent acknowledgement that taxes will need to rise is likely to act as a further brake on economic growth, increasing the pressure on the BoE to lower rates in the medium term.” PHILIP SHAW, CHIEF ECONOMIST, INVESTEC, LONDON: “The bigger picture is the MPC feels sufficiently relaxed about the risk of inflation persistence to cut the bank rate for the first time in over four years. The various signs of loosening in the labour market appear to be a big factor in the decision today and that’s outweighed the recent stuff on services inflation, which held at 5.7% in June. The question is where do we go now? We do think MPC will bring rates down again this year. The common thread with central banks is the Committee is in data-dependent mode and I think we’re going to see that phrase uttered a lot, not just in the UK but in other developed markets.” COLIN ASHER, ECONOMIST, MIZUHO, LONDON: ""If you look at the headlines that Bailey produced: caution on cutting too quickly or by too much, it implies to me that they're looking at a steady quarterly pace of reductions. So I would probably expect the next cut to come in November, assuming that the macro economic developments unfold as they expect."" ""Generally speaking, I would expect sterling to gradually strengthen. I think you might be able to term this a hawkish cut, as in, you have guidance from Bailey suggesting not to go too far or too fast. And then in contrast from (Chair Jerome) Powell, you have the Federal Reserve looking reasonably dovish and to me that suggests upside for sterling in the medium term."" DANIELE ANTONUCCI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, QUINTET PRIVATE BANK, LUXEMBOURG: ""Keeping rates too high for too long would have caused unwarranted economic weakness and therefore, an undershoot of the Bank’s inflation mandate to the downside. Even though it makes sense to proceed at a moderate pace, beginning to soften the degree of monetary tightening looks like the most sensible approach. We’ve increased our exposure to short-dated gilts. This is because short-dated bonds are most sensitive to central bank rate changes. With the Bank of England having just cut rates and likely to continue to do so, one-to-three-year gilts could benefit."" DEAN TURNER, CHIEF EUROZONE AND UK ECONOMIST, UBS GLOBAL WEALTH MANAGEMENT, LONDON: ""In our view, further easing is likely in the coming months as the disinflationary trends continue into the new year. The prospect of lower interest rates should continue to favour taking exposure to high-quality corporate and government bonds."" ""As for sterling, it has struggled to build on its recent gains, but we see potential for upward momentum to resume when the Fed joins the interest-cutting cycle, which we expect it to do when it meets in September.” JEREMY BATSTONE-CARR, STRATEGIST, RAYMOND JAMES, FRANCE: ""The UK’s economic performance has been stronger than expected in recent months, moving past the residual effects of earlier inflation and providing an economic boost for the newly installed Labour government. However, real interest rates remain high and there has been a stronger-than-expected strengthening in demand over potential supply constraints, notably in the labour market. Despite this, the Committee has taken a leap of faith in cutting rates, hoping to stimulate consumers with lower borrowing costs and increased spending power."" NEIL BIRRELL, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, PREMIER MITON INVESTORS, LONDON: ""Falling UK interest rates have arrived at last. The Bank of England has moved from worrying about inflation to worrying about economic growth, although they are bound to be cautious about further cuts and can’t lead the bond market to expect too much too soon. But, it is an important move, with only the U.S. not joining the global rate cutting party to date. We could see financial markets further reflect the turn in the cycle, at aggregate level, but probably more so within asset classes."" JASON SIMPSON, SENIOR FIXED INCOME STRATEGIST, STATE STREET, LONDON: ""If there's a perception of fiscal loosening then the market will see a lot more gilt supply coming into the market that has to be absorbed and a bit of an inflationary impact so that shine on gilts might fade."" JULIUS BENDIKAS, EUROPEAN HEAD OF ECONOMICS AND DYNAMIC ASSET ALLOCATION, MERCER, LONDON: ""We viewed this decision as a surprise, especially given elevated wage growth. Having said that, we expect 1 to 2 more rate cuts in 2024 with more to come in 2025. The economy has normalised, so should the interest rates."" MICHAEL BROWN, MARKET STRATEGIST, PEPPERSTONE, LONDON: ""Looking ahead, a relatively gradual quarterly pace of cuts seems most plausible for the (Bank of England), with further normalisation likely to coincide with meetings at which a Monetary Policy Report is published, leaving the base case as just one more cut this year, at the November meeting. Such a pace would be broadly in line with that priced by markets, and that likely to be delivered by other G10 central banks, potentially limiting any prolonged sterling downside on the back of today's decision."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/goldman-sachs-sees-belowconsensus-july-jobs-report-3548416,"Following a largely anticipated statement from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) on Wednesday, the market focus has now shifted to the upcoming employment report due on Friday. Economists and analysts largely expect the report to provide signs that economic conditions are conducive to a rate cut in September. Goldman Sachs economists estimate that nonfarm payrolls rose by 165,000 in July, below the consensus of 175,000 and the three-month average of 177,000. They also estimate a 125,000 increase in private payrolls, compared to the consensus of 148,000. ""While an influx of labor supply at the start of summer typically leads to an acceleration in seasonally-adjusted job growth when the labor market is tight, alternative measures of job growth indicate a pace of job creation below the recent payrolls trend, and we assume a 15k drag from Hurricane Beryl,” they said in a note. Hurricane Beryl, which caused power outages for over 2 million Texans, significantly impacted employment in the state. Goldman noted its past analyses have shown that major hurricanes typically reduce payroll growth by around 25,000 on average, although the effects vary depending on the severity and timing of the storm. In fairness, the hurricane had only a modest impact on this week’s ADP employment report, with employment growth in the Texas region about 10,000 below its average pace from the first half of the year. For the unemployment rate, Goldman Sachs economists expect it to remain unchanged at 4.1%, in line with consensus. The Wall Street firm pointed out two-sided risks to this forecast. Continued, though slowing, above-trend immigration could increase the unemployment rate, while a catch-up of household employment towards nonfarm payrolls, after a period of underperformance, could decrease it. Economists also estimate that average hourly earnings rose 0.3% month-over-month, which would reduce the year-over-year rate by two-tenths to 3.7%, consistent with consensus and last month's increase. ""This month’s calendar configuration should weigh on average hourly earnings, but the impact of Hurricane Beryl could boost them, as reported hours typically fall more sharply than earnings during severe weather events,” they noted."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/bank-of-england-cuts-base-rate-by-25-bps-to-50-3548257,"Investing.com - The Bank of England cut interest rates from a 16-year high Thursday, the first reduction since the pandemic as policymakers judged inflation sufficiently tamed to provide the economy with a boost. Policymakers voted 5 to 4 to cut the by 25 basis points to 5.0%, after U.K. returned to the BOE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, falling from the 41-year high of 11.1% seen in October 2022. There had been a great deal of uncertainty surrounding this meeting as key policymakers had not spoken publicly for more than two months in the run-up to the country’s general election in early July. Additionally, data released earlier Thursday showed that British factories recorded their best month for two years during July, with the S&P Global rising to 52.1 from 50.9, its highest reading since July 2022. Output and new orders increased at the fastest rate since February 2022, while manufacturers added staff for the first time in 22 months. Bank of England Chief Economist Huw Pill said last month that it was an open question whether the BoE would cut interest rates at the August meeting, as underlying price pressures showed ""uncomfortable strength."" The Bank will publish its quarterly Monetary Policy Report alongside the rate announcement and hold a press conference. “We expect the updated BoE projections to show higher near-term growth projections, while continuing to show inflation dipping below 2% in 2026, thus signalling that rates will possibly need to be cut more than currently priced by the markets,” analysts at UBS said, in a note."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-developer-returns-buyers-deposits-for-unfinished-homes-local-media-says-3548104,"BEIJING (Reuters) - A Chinese property developer is giving back homebuyers the deposit they paid for apartments in a project it was unable to finish as part of a housing return programme coordinated by the local authorities, official media reported. The refund coordinated by the government of the city of Nanjing is believed to be the first such case in China, the New Beijing News reported this week, and could set a precedent for other cities and developers to resolve the problem of unfinished homes that has dogged the real estate sector. Since 2021, many developers across China have been unable to complete the construction of projects due to defaults. Policymakers are demanding developers to resolve the issue and deliver homes to buyers in order to ensure social stability. In the eastern city of Nanjing, 33 of the 42 buyers of a development called Zhujiang Siji Yuecheng, which began pre-construction sales in April 2022, have signed agreements with the developer to return their flats and recoup their deposit, the New Beijing News said. The developer is allowed to use the proceeds in the project's escrow account, totalling 50.67 million yuan ($7 million), to refund the buyers. Escrow accounts are monitored by banks and the funds inside are usually allowed to be used to only finance construction. The project had stopped construction around mid-2022 after the main contractor - Jiangsu Suzhong Construction Group - was hit by liquidity problems as it was one of the main suppliers to now defaulted developer China (HK: ) Group, according to the newspaper. The debt crisis among Chinese developers has created a glut of unfinished presold homes that have heavily weighed on home prices, consumer confidence and economic growth. Even though the authorities have rolled out a slew of measures to boost property demand including reducing purchase costs and mortgage rates, homebuyers are still avoiding the market as they worry that new homes will not be delivered in a timely manner. The politburo, a top decision-making body, on Tuesday pledged to continue to support the delivery of unfinished projects and turn unsold apartments into affordable housing. Zhang Dawei, chief analyst at property agency Centaline, said the refund programme will likely make it more difficult to guarantee the delivery of unfinished homes. ""The vast majority of local governments and developers are unable to refund the owners of unfinished developments on a large scale, and Nanjing's practice can hardly serve as an example,"" Zhang said.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-guidance-boe-metas-results-apple--whats-moving-markets-3547878,"Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve kept rates unchanged but signaled the possibility of a cut next month. The Bank of England has that decision to make later in the session. Meta Platforms impressed with its quarterly earnings, and Apple is next up after the close. 1. Fed lifts September rate cut confidence The U.S. left interest rates unchanged at the conclusion of its latest policy-setting meeting on Wednesday, as widely expected, but acknowledged recent progress on inflation, raising investor hopes that the central bank could begin cutting rates in the near future. The Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, kept its benchmark rate in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%, as it has done over the past year as it battled elevated inflation. However, recent data point to progress on inflation, suggesting that the Fed's restrictive policies are working. ""Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated,"" the Fed said Wednesday in its July policy statement, with the addition of the word “somewhat” marking a subtle change from its June statement. A September rate cut of 25 basis points is now almost fully priced in, according to Investing.com's , but traders also added to bets the Federal Reserve will go big when it does cut. Rate futures prices now reflect about a 17% chance of a 50-basis point rate cut in September, versus about 5% before Wednesday’s meeting. The Fed also acknowledged a cooling in the labor market, stating that the committee is ""attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate"" - to maintain stable prices and strive for maximum employment. Friday sees the release of the closely watched monthly report, as investors try to gauge whether recent signs of cooling in the labor market continued in July. Economists are expecting the U.S. economy to have created 177,000 jobs in July, moderating from 206,000 in the prior month. 2. Futures steady after Fed meeting U.S. stock futures traded in a steady manner Thursday, as investors digested the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as more corporate earnings. By 04:25 ET (08:25 GMT), the contract was 40 points, or 0.1%, lower, while climbed 7 points, or 0.1%, and rose by 45 points, or 0.2%. The Wall Street indices closed higher Wednesday, with the gaining 16%, its best day since February, the surging 2.6%, and the rose 0.2%. These gains followed the Fed signaling that a rate cut could occur in September if inflation continues to cool. There are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Apple (NASDAQ: ) [see below] and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Intel (NASDAQ: ), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: ) and (NASDAQ: ). Economic data due for release Thursday includes weekly data, for June and data for July, ahead of Friday’s widely-watched monthly jobs report. 3. Meta soars after impressive Q2 Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) reported strong second-quarter earnings after the close Wednesday, bucking the recent trend of poorly received results from the country’s mega cap tech companies. Meta Platforms, the company that owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, beat market expectations for second-quarter revenue, seeing quarterly growth of 22%. Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li told analysts on a call that the company was ""continuing to see healthy global advertising demand"", benefiting from its plans to use artificial intelligence to improve targeting, ranking and delivery systems for digital ads on its platforms. The tech giant also issued a rosy sales forecast for the third quarter, signaling that robust digital-ad spending on its social media platforms can cover the cost of its artificial-intelligence investments. Although Meta's costs rose 7% in the second quarter, its revenue jump topped expense growth substantially and led to a 9-point rise in operating margin, to 38% from 29%. Meta stock soared over 7% after hours, contrasting with the losses that both Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) and Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) suffered when they released these numbers over the last few days. 4. Apple revenue to bounce back in Q3 It’s Apple's (NASDAQ: ) turn to face the judgment of investors, as the iPhone maker releases its fiscal third-quarter results after the close Thursday. Apple's revenue is expected to have risen 3.3% in the third quarter from a year earlier, bouncing back after a decline of 4.3% in the second quarter, as it won back some customers in China with big iPhone discounts. Sales of the iPhone, which account for nearly half of Apple's revenue, are expected to have decreased by 2.2% in the three months ended June, a big improvement from the 10.5% decline in the second quarter, according to LSEG data. Under pressure from a resurgent Huawei in China, Apple in May offered hefty discounts on select iPhone models, helping narrow sales declines in the country. Elsewhere,  iPad sales likely jumped 14.1%, the fastest growth since the holiday quarter of 2022, after Apple launched a new AI-focused iPad Pro and a larger iPad Air in May to revive demand for this product line. Apple's shares have risen nearly 30% in the past three months, though a recent market selloff led by megacaps led to the stock slipping more than 7% from its July 15 record. 5. Bank of England to cut? The completes this week’s round of central bank rate decisions later Thursday, after the Bank of Japan delivered its second interest rate hike in 17 years and the U.S. Federal Reserve hinted it could lower rates in September after standing pat. The moves, or lack of them, by the and the Fed were largely expected, but there is greater uncertainty than usual of the Bank of England's meeting as key policymakers have not spoken publicly for more than two months in the run-up to the country’s general election in early July. The Bank of England has held its benchmark interest rate at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the past year as it tackled inflation, which soared to a 41-year high of 11.1% in October 2022. U.K. returned to the BOE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, suggesting a cut later Thursday is a distinct possibility. In June, the MPC voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the meeting recorded that several of those who voted to hold had been close to voting for a cut."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/low-bar-for-september-fed-rate-cut-jobs-data-now-key-3547850,"The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) delivered a largely expected message during its July meeting. While he did not give specific guidance, Chairman Jerome Powel signaled that the committee is moving closer to implementing a rate cut, with a potential reduction on the table for September, contingent on favorable inflation data. According to Goldman Sachs economists, Powell’s comments “suggest the bar is not very high” for a September cut. The Fed Chair described recent labor market changes, including the rise in the unemployment rate, as signs of normalization rather than significant weakening. He emphasized that the FOMC is closely monitoring the data and is well-prepared to act if necessary. ""We continue to expect that the July inflation data will be favorable (we forecast 21bp for core CPI and 19bp for core PCE) and think that even acceptable news would likely clinch a September cut,” Goldman economists commented. After this, they anticipate the FOMC will adopt a pattern of cutting rates every other meeting, equating to a once-per-quarter pace. Separately, Citi economists said the labor market data will be key in determining the Fed’s next steps. Powell noted that while inflation is running ""somewhat"" above target, the upside risks have diminished, and downside risks to the labor market are building. He referred to the Sahm rule—where a 0.5 percentage point rise in the three-month moving average unemployment rate has historically indicated a downturn—as a ""statistical regularity"" rather than an ""economic rule."" He also highlighted the unemployment rate as a useful summary statistic, meaning that markets will continue to be sensitive to that indicator. Citi pointed out two minor adjustments in FOMC’s statement to reflect rising unemployment and slowing inflation. The FOMC stated that the unemployment rate “has moved up but remains low,” while progress toward 2% inflation was described as “some further progress.” The most significant update was the Committee's attention to “risks on both sides of its dual mandate.” “This formalizes in the Committee statement that risks to the employment and price stability mandates have come into balance – something Chair Powell has stated multiple times,” Citi economists said. They continue to expect that the Fed will impose a rate cut in September and at each subsequent meeting, aiming for a terminal rate of 3.25-3.50% by 2025. Citi also notes that a further decline in front-end Treasury yields signals that the market is now close to pricing in the three 25 basis point rate reductions they project for the rest of the year."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/boj-sees-chance-of-overshoot-in-wages-inflation-3547668,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan said on Thursday there was a chance wage and price growth could overshoot expectations as labour markets tighten. In a full version of its quarterly outlook report, the central bank also said service-sector firms were becoming more keen to pass on rising labour costs through price increases. ""There is a possibility that wage growth and inflation may overshoot, accompanied by heightening medium- and long-term inflation expectations, amid a tight job market,"" the BOJ said in the report. Japanese firms typically review prices for their services in April, which is the start of a new fiscal year, and October. In April, an increasing number of service-sector firms raised prices to make up for higher labour costs, the BOJ said. The key would be whether such changes in price-setting behaviour broaden among service-sector firms in October, and whether the moves will be sustained, it said. The BOJ raised interest rates on Wednesday, taking another step towards phasing out its radical stimulus due to a growing conviction that Japan is making progress towards durably achieving its 2% inflation target. In a summary of the outlook report released on Wednesday, the BOJ maintained its projection from April that inflation would stay around its 2% target in coming years."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-england-close-to-cutting-rates-from-16year-high-3547455,"By David Milliken LONDON (Reuters) - The Bank of England looks in a position to cut interest rates on Thursday after holding them at a 16-year high of 5.25% for the past year, though markets and economists are far from certain the British central bank will take the plunge. Economists polled by Reuters last week overwhelmingly expected a quarter-point cut but think the vote will be close on the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee, with only a 5-4 majority in favour. Late on Wednesday, financial markets were pricing in a 66% chance of a quarter-point cut, and then expected one more quarter-point cut before the end of the year. ""It's certainly going to be a finely balanced decision. You can see that from the market pricing,"" said Jack Meaning, chief UK economist at Barclays. In June, the MPC voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but minutes of the meeting recorded that several of those who voted to hold had been close to voting for a cut. How those policymakers' views have shifted since then is hard to tell. Only one potential swing voter - chief economist Huw Pill - spoke during the two-and-a-half week window between the end of Britain's election campaign on July 4 and the start of the BoE's pre-decision quiet period last week. There has also been a change of personnel - with former OECD and finance ministry chief economist Clare Lombardelli succeeding Ben Broadbent as deputy governor, giving the MPC a female majority for the first time. British consumer price inflation returned to the BoE's 2% target in May and stayed there in June, down from a 41-year high of 11.1% struck in October 2022. This leaves British inflation lower than in the euro zone - where the European Central Bank cut rates in June - and the United States, where on Wednesday the Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady but opened the door to a September cut. However, the BoE expects headline inflation to edge up over the coming months and is more focused on what it sees as the medium-term drivers of inflation: services prices, wages and more general tightness in the labour market. Services price inflation is the biggest sticking point. At 5.7% in June, it has fallen much less than the BoE forecast three months ago. The question for policymakers is whether that represents greater medium-term pressures, or is due to one-off effects such as a surge in hotel prices during concert tours by artists such as U.S. singer Taylor Swift. NO TIME TO DELAY? Meaning, a former BoE economist, said policymakers would be wrong to delay a rate cut until September. ""There is always a reason to wait a little bit longer ... (but) if you wait until it's absolutely conclusive, then you've probably waited too long,"" he said. By September, official data is likely to show headline inflation back above 2% - superficially making a rate-cut look ill-timed - and, unlike in August, there is no scheduled press conference for Governor Andrew Bailey to explain the decision. Moreover, updated BoE forecasts on Thursday are likely to still show inflation falling back below its 2% target in the medium term - making a rate cut necessary sooner rather than later, given the time it takes for lower rates to affect prices. The September meeting is also when the MPC must hold an annual vote on the pace at which it reverses past quantitative easing - a decision that it tries to keep distinct from its regular votes on interest rates. However, it is possible the MPC will opt for caution. Bailey in June said that policymakers ""need to be sure that inflation will stay low"" before cutting rates, and Pill last month said wages and services prices continued to show ""uncomfortable strength"". Growth so far this year has also been stronger than the BoE or most economists expected ""While it will be a very close call, the economy's recent strength and the stickiness of services inflation leads us to think that the Bank of England will wait,"" said Ruth Gregory, deputy chief UK economist at Capital Economics."

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/brazil-holds-interest-rates-as-expected-flags-greater-caution-3547398,"By Andre Romani SAO PAULO (Reuters) -Brazil's central bank on Wednesday kept interest rates unchanged at a second consecutive policy meeting, as expected, flagging a need for ""more vigilance"" in monetary policy due to worsening inflation expectations and recent market swings. The bank's rate-setting committee, known as Copom, held the Selic benchmark interest rate at 10.50% in a unanimous decision, in line with forecasts from all 40 economists polled by Reuters. Inflation has outpaced expectations and Brazil's currency has depreciated nearly 4% since the bank's last policy meeting in mid-June, flirting with more than two-year lows amid investor concerns about fiscal discipline. ""The Committee judges that the domestic and international environments require even greater caution on the conduct of monetary policy,"" wrote policymakers in their policy statement. ""In particular, the inflationary impacts of the movements of market variables and inflation expectations, if persistent, corroborate the need for more vigilance,"" they added. Citi analysts said they still expect the Selic rate to be held at 10.50% in coming meetings, despite the rising risks on the inflation outlook. ""The unquestionable deterioration in the inflation outlook pushed Copom to escalate the hawkish tone, although not yet indicating an imminent interest rate hike,"" Citi analysts wrote in a report. Inflation projections for this year climbed to 4.10% in the latest central bank survey, more than a full percentage point above the 3.0% center of the official policy target. Sticky services inflation also pushed up consumer prices more than forecast in the month to mid-July, driven up higher fuel and airfare costs. Rafaela Vitoria, chief-economist at lender Inter, said the committee had a ""cautions tone, stressing the need to keep monetary policy in a contractionary territory until the disinflation process is consolidated"". The central bank kept rates unchanged even as Brazil's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva has repeatedly pushed for a lower Selic. At an official event in Mato Grosso state on Wednesday, Lula said minutes before the central bank decision that inflation is under control and that interest rates need to be reduced. The central bank on Wednesday raised its base scenario inflation projections to 4.2% this year and 3.6% for 2025, up from 4% and 3.4% previously. The monetary authority on Wednesday published its first price increase projections for the first quarter of 2026, seeing an inflation rate of 3.4% under its base scenario."

The Fed ended its latest two-day policy meeting with a decision to hold its benchmark interest rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range that was set a year ago, but its statement softened the description of inflation and said the risks to employment were now on a par with those of rising prices - neutral language that opens the door for rates to fall after more than two years of tightening credit. Powell pushed the message even further forward in his post-meeting press conference, noting that price pressures were now easing broadly in the economy - what he called ""quality"" disinflation - and that if coming data evolves as anticipated, support for cutting rates will grow. ""If we were to see inflation moving down ... more or less in line with expectations, growth remains reasonably strong, and the labor market remains consistent with current conditions, then I think a rate cut could be on the table at the September meeting,"" he said. Republican lawmakers warned in a hearing with Powell in July that a rate cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, seven weeks before the U.S. elections, could be seen as a politicized move - highlighting progress on inflation and offering the mood-lifting promise of cheaper credit and home mortgages in the near future. The Fed chief, in response to a question from a reporter on Wednesday, said the central bank's only consideration was the state and direction of the economy and the progress of inflation back to its 2% annual target, not the political calendar or any party's fortunes. ""This is how we think about it. This is what we do,"" Powell said. Some Fed policymakers even discussed the logic of cutting rates at this session, Powell said, but ""the sense of the (policy-setting) committee was not at this meeting, but as soon as the next meeting depending on how the data come in."" SETTING THE STAGE Powell's remarks on Wednesday affirmed what investors had come to see as a near certainty that the Fed would pivot in September from an era of restrictive, some would say punishing, interest rates, to a steady easing of credit policy that would see inflation finish the journey to the 2% level without undue damage to the labor market. Powell said he felt such a ""soft landing"" was in view, with data that is ""not signaling a weak economy. It is also not signaling an overheating economy,"" he noted. The Fed's new policy statement took that optimistic outlook on board, noting that ""there has been some further progress toward the (Federal Open Market) Committee's 2% objective,"" while the unemployment rate, at 4.1%, ""remains low."" The central bank uses the personal consumption expenditures price index for its 2% inflation target. The PCE price index rose 2.5% in June after exceeding 7% in 2022, and the month-to-month readings recently have shown it even closer to the target. Investors saw Powell's comments as clearly setting the stage for a reduction in borrowing costs at the Fed's Sept. 17-18 meeting. ""Listening to him speak, it's clear they're all locked and loaded for a September rate cut and they're going to maintain their optionality,"" said Mark Malek, chief investment officer at SiebertNXT. Interest rate futures, stocks and Treasury bonds all rallied hard on Powell's remarks, so much so that the probability of a first cut in September being as large as half a percentage point jumped to about 13% from about 5% before he began speaking, according to CME Group's (NASDAQ: ) FedWatch tool. Powell, however, said a 50-basis-point cut was not something under active consideration. While Fed officials are wary of any actions that could mar their data-not-politics approach to setting monetary policy, the steady drop in inflation in recent months prompted a broad consensus that the inflation battle was near an end. Inflation, the Fed said in its unanimously approved statement, was now just ""somewhat elevated,"" a key downgrade from the assessment that it has used for nearly three years that it was ""elevated."" The Fed's policy statement also removed standing language that it was ""highly attentive to inflation risks,"" and replaced it with an acknowledgement that policymakers were now ""attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,"" which includes a charge from Congress to maintain maximum employment consistent with stable prices. So far the economy ""has continued to expand at a solid pace,"" the Fed said in its statement, and while ""job gains have moderated,"" the unemployment rate ""remains low."" But the jobless rate has been rising, and policymakers have put more focus of late on avoiding the sort of sharp rise in unemployment often associated with high interest rates and slowing inflation."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/feds-powell-rejects-idea-politics-has-any-bearing-on-policy-choices-3547373,"By Michael S. Derby (Reuters) - U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell said on Wednesday political considerations play no part in either near-term monetary policy deliberations or the central bank's longer-run forecasting work. ""We don't change anything in our approach to address other factors like the political calendar,"" Powell said at a press conference that followed the most recent meeting of the central bank's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee. ""I'll say this too: We never use our tools to support or oppose a political party, a politician or any political outcome."" Powell addressed the Fed's intent to stay out of the political fray as the central considers a possible rate cut in September, less than two months before the November presidential election. While the FOMC left rates steady and maintained its interest rate target range at between 5.25% and 5.5%, where its been for a year now, easing inflation data has almost certainly opened the door to a rate cut in the next few months. In his press conference Powell wouldn't commit to an action but strongly suggested that if the data continues on its current path, a rate cut at the Fed's next meeting on Sept. 17-18 was possible. If the Fed cuts rates in September, it would likely set the central bank up for criticism from Republican presidential contender Donald Trump. When he was last in office, the former president was a sharp critic of the Fed and Powell. In a recent Bloomberg Businessweek interview, he said a pre-election rate cut is ""something that they know they shouldn’t be doing,” presumably because easier borrowing conditions might favor his presumptive Democratic opponent, Kamala Harris. Fed officials have consistently argued that politics do not bear on their monetary policy choices and Powell reiterated that point in his press conference, saying it's the data alone that will make the call for when the Fed is able to cut interest rates. ""This is my fourth presidential election at the Fed,"" Powell said, and with that experience, any monetary policy choice ""will be based on the data, the outlook and balance of risks and not on anything else."" FORECASTING FACTORS Powell also said that potential changes in the nation's political direction are not something central bankers will take on board as part of their longer-range forecasts, which are made public on a quarterly basis, with the next update due in September. ""We absolutely do not do that,"" Powell said, noting the inherent uncertainty in knowing who might win a given election. While it's possible to ""run simple simulations of different potential policies"" a government might pursue, changing actual Fed policy to reflect these types of shifts is ""a line we would never cross,"" Powell said, adding ""we don't want to be involved in politics in any way, so we wouldn't do that."" The question of whether the Fed should factor a change in administration or control of Congress into its forecasts and policy outlook is being driven by Trump's economic agenda. Experts across ideological stripes believe the former president's pro-tariff, anti-immigration and tax-cut agenda means inflation would again rise. For some, those risks might mean the Fed needs to rethink some of its longer-run hopes for rate cuts and lower inflation. Some former Fed officials have even argued in favor of factoring that outlook in, although current officials have rejected that view. Derek Tang, an analyst at LHMeyer, a forecasting firm, is skeptical the Fed can shrug off politics' impact on forecasts. ""Powell acknowledged that they run alternative scenarios but then denied that it filters through to their forecasts,"" Tang said. ""This does not seem believable given that the 2025, 2026, (and, in September, 2027) macro projections and dots are a crucial piece of their forward guidance,"" and for those forecasts to be taken seriously, Fed watchers would need to know the central bank is thinking about how shifts in government policy will affect the economy, he said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-keeps-rates-steady-but-acknowledges-inflation-progress-3546710,"Investing.com -- The Federal Reserve left interest rates unchanged Wednesday, but acknowledged recent progress on inflation and cooling in the labor market, stoking investor hopes that the central bank could begin cutting rates sooner rather than later. The Federal Open Market Committee, the FOMC, kept its in a range of 5.25% to 5.5%. The Fed has kept rates unchanged over the past year as it assessed incoming data to guide policy decisions. Recent reports showing progress on inflation and easing tightness in the labor market suggest that the Fed's restrictive policies are working following a slew of bumpy inflation data earlier this year. The most recent measure of core personal consumption expenditure, or PCE, index, the Fed's preferred inflation gauge, showed inflation remain steady at 2.6% in the 12 months through June, and is moving toward the central bank's 2% target. ""Inflation has eased over the past year but remains somewhat elevated,"" the Fed said Wednesday in its July policy statement. That marked a subtle change from June, when the Fed noted that inflation had eased but remained ""elevated."" In a sign the cooling in the labor market is now on the Fed's radar, the Fed said the committee is ""attentive to the risks to both sides of its dual mandate,"" signaling a shift from June when the focus remained solely on ""inflation risks."" ""The Committee judges that the risks to achieving its employment and inflation goals continue to move into better balance, the Fed added. Still, despite the recent progress, the Fed believes it still needs ""greater confidence"" that inflation is moving toward 2%. Many are betting, however, that economic data in the coming weeks would help shift the Fed toward a first cut. A September rate cut is now almost fully priced in, according to Investing.com's In the press conference that followed the meeting, Powell said no decision had been made about future meetings including September, but signaled that the committee is moving closer toward rate cuts should the data continue to show progress on inflation and cooling in the labor market. ""We think that the time [for a rate cut] is approaching ... if we do get the data that we hope we can, then a reduction in our policy rate could be on the table in September,"" Powell said. The focus will be on the next two CPI and employment releases before September. RBC said it expect to see improvements continue, prompting ""a first rate cut from the Fed at its next meeting."" Concerns are building, however, that delaying rate cuts risks the Fed falling behind the curve and stoking a hard landing. Powell said, however, the Fed would respond if growth deteriorated rapidly, though added that the economy isn't signaling for a rescue as the slowdown has been growth has been gradual. ""We have a lot of room to respond if we were to see weakness,"" Powell added. ""That's not what we're seeing."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-chair-powells-speech-firmly-risk-positive-evercore-3547157,"Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell indicated a potential interest rate cut in the upcoming September meeting, a move that has been widely expected. Powell's dovish tone at the press conference surpassed the cautious wording of the July Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) statement, according to economists at Evercore ISI. This suggests that the central bank is closer to reducing rates. ""[H]is comments suggest the Fed is alert to risk of more severe weakening and we think it would react aggressively if it saw scary cracks emerging,"" they said. During the presser, Powell discussed that some members of the Committee had already considered an immediate rate cut at the July meeting, although this was not the majority view. He mentioned that recent data on inflation has boosted their confidence, and further positive data would only strengthen it. Despite labor data showing signs of moderation, Powell stated that there isn't substantial evidence to support a significant weakening in the labor market. Powell emphasized that while no decision for September has been finalized, the decision would be based on a range of data, rather than a single data point. He clarified that the Fed's decision would consider the totality of data, the economic outlook, and the balance of risks. ""We continue to expect the Fed to cut in September and at each subsequent meeting to reach a terminal rate of 3.25-3.50% in 2025,"" Citi economists wrote. Powell is expected to provide a more definitive signal at the Jackson Hole symposium at the end of August, after considering another month's worth of economic data."

TRAVIS KESHEMBERG, SENIOR PORTFOLIO MANAGER FOR THE SYSTEMATIC EDGE MULTI-ASSET TEAM, ALLSPRING GLOBAL INVESTMENTS, SAN FRANCISCO “Our base case is for the Fed to make its first cut in September and remain neutral from a forward guidance perspective, analyzing incoming data to inform future rate-cut decisions. Growth and jobs are not yet at a point that justifies a prolonged cutting cycle and less-restrictive monetary policy. We expect to see conditions deteriorate and thereby support further rate cuts later in the fourth quarter of 2024. “We continue to favor bonds, which benefit from moderating growth and moderating inflation, particularly internationally. We also continue to like equities. We expect broadening of the equity rally, and any relief from perceived looser monetary policy would likely support equity prices in the medium term. “Geopolitical uncertainty in the U.S. has increased in July, and we expect the Fed will take this situation into account in its decision-making.” DON CALCAGNI, CHIEF INVESTMENT OFFICER, MERCER ADVISORS, DENVER, COLORADO ""It's certainly what the market expected which is the right thing for the Fed to do, to sit tight.""

BRIAN JACOBSEN, CHIEF ECONOMIST, ANNEX WEALTH MANAGEMENT, MENOMONEE FALLS, WISCONSIN“The Fed is tiptoeing towards being confident enough to cut.

The Fed is going to have its day in the sun in September with a 25 or 50 basis point cut, but I would not be surprised if that is already priced into stocks. We may actually see the market down significantly the day the Fed actually cuts rates in September.” MICHELE RANERI, HEAD OF U.S. RESEARCH AND CONSULTING AT TRANSUNION IN CHICAGO  (in an email ) “There continues to be positive indicators that this may be the last meeting before we see an interest rate reduction at the next Fed meeting in September, with the possibility of a second rate reduction for 2024 still on the table. “As it applies to consumer demand for credit around large purchases such as homes and autos, this will likely begin to increase if, and when rates eventually begin to fall. Indeed, we are even seeing some early indicators that consumers are becoming more interested in new mortgages. Until rates do drop meaningfully, however, consumers should continue to use credit wisely and only to the extent that they know they can make their minimum monthly payments on.”"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/colombia-central-bank-cuts-benchmark-rate-to-1075-raises-growth-outlook-3546767,"By Nelson Bocanegra BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombia's central bank cut its benchmark interest rate by 50 basis points to 10.75% on Wednesday, its sixth cut since December, as the bank's technical team raised its growth outlook for the year. The decision was backed by five of the central bank's seven board members. Two members pushed for a cut of 75 basis points, the central bank said in a statement. The decision was in line with market expectations. All 22 analysts quizzed in a Reuters poll last week said they expected the board to vote to cut the rate to 10.75%, down from 11.25%, taking the benchmark interest rate to its lowest level since 2022. Earlier, the U.S. Federal Reserve voted unanimously to keep its benchmark overnight interest rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range, citing ""elevated"" inflation, but it signaled that a rate cut in September was possible. The technical team of Colombia's central bank on Wednesday revised its growth outlook for the year to 1.8%, up from 1.4% previously, the bank said in a statement. Colombia's 12-month inflation through the end of June was 7.18%, marginally above the 7.16% rate at the end of May, putting the brakes on a downward trajectory and keeping inflation well above the bank's 3% target. Wednesday's rate decision takes accumulated cuts to a total of 250 basis points since December. The meeting comes just weeks before Colombia publishes its second-quarter growth figure, which will be key in determining what measures are needed to push the economy further, analysts say."

""A soft landing is likely with moderating inflation and low unemployment, and we are projecting annual economic growth of 2.1%, down from 2.5% in 2023,"" the ratings agency said. U.S. prices increased moderately in June as declining cost of goods tempered a rise in the cost of services, underscoring improving inflation environment that economists and analysts expect could help the Fed to begin cutting rates in September. The report from the Commerce Department on Friday showed consumer spending slowed a bit last month. Signs of easing price pressures and a cooling labor market could boost the confidence of Fed officials that inflation is moving toward the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Fitch said U.S. consumer spending continues to hold up well, but it anticipates a modestly weaker credit environment in the second half of the year. The comments follow earnings reports from several large U.S. banks, payments and consumer companies, which showed a weakening environment for U.S. consumers, with pressure building on the lower-income bracket."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/japans-central-bank-should-gradually-hike-rates-to-1-suntory-ceo-says-3546291,"By Divya Chowdhury MUMBAI (Reuters) - The Bank of Japan should continue to gradually increase its interest rates up to the level of 1% by next year, Suntory Chief Executive Takeshi Niinami said on Wednesday. ""That's still lower than the inflation (rate),"" Niinami, who also heads one of Japan's biggest business lobbies, told the Reuters Global Markets Forum. The comments came after Japan's central bank hiked interest rates to 0.25%, defying dominant market expectations to take its short-term policy rate to levels unseen since 2008, and also unveiled a detailed plan to slow its historic bond-buying binge. A gradual increase in interest rates by the BOJ will provide crucial time to small and medium enterprises to adjust and prepare for a tighter borrowing environment, Niinami said. ""This time the governor has showed the commitment to keep raising the rates,"" Niinami said. Niinami added that he was still worried about a weaker yen, even at current levels, since it puts inflationary pressures on the general public, companies and the government's balance sheet and fiscal policy. The yen has rallied around 7.4% in July from nearly 162 to the dollar, almost halving the U.S. unit's march higher on the Japanese currency since the beginning of 2024. On the day, the yen is trading 1.5% higher, at 150.47 to the dollar. Niinami also confirmed that Suntory was not in talks to buy American brewer Boston Beer (NYSE: ), known for its Samuel Adams brand, as reported by the Wall Street Journal in May. ""Boston Beer is our partner to deal with 'Ready To Drink' (RTD) in the United States, so we have no intention to negotiate, and they don't have no intention to negotiate with us,"" Niinami said. ""That's very clear."" Gen Z is a key market for Suntory in the canned cocktail segment, Niinami said, adding that the company aimed to increase its revenue share from RTD to 20% to 25% of its spirits business over the next five years. To achieve this, Suntory will focus on growing its markets in China, Europe and the United States, Niinami said. (Join GMF, a chat room hosted on LSEG Messenger, for live interviews: )"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/explainerwhat-taxes-can-uk-finance-minister-rachel-reeves-raise-in-her-first-budget-3545884,"By Andy Bruce (Reuters) - British finance minister Rachel Reeves plans to raise taxes when she presents her budget in three months' time, but her options are limited by her promise not to increase taxes paid by ""working people"". On Monday, Reeves said the Labour government, which won a landslide victory in the July 4 election, had inherited a hole in the public finances of 22 billion pounds ($28 billion). She has warned that taxes would need to rise in the Oct. 31 Budget, while sticking to Labour's manifesto commitment that not to raise the rates of income tax, national insurance, value-added tax or corporation tax. Below are some of Reeves' options: CAPITAL GAINS TAX Capital gains tax raised 15 billion pounds in the last financial year. While worth only around 4% of receipts from all taxes on income, Reeves may try to up that figure. CGT is charged at a much lower rate than the upper rates of income tax, reflecting past attempts to encourage entrepreneurship. But this led hundreds of thousands of people to convert ordinary income into capital gains to lower their tax bill. The Resolution Foundation think tank said Reeves could increase the rates of CGT but soften the blow by reintroducing indexation - meaning capital gains are taxed only after inflation. Together, these measures could raise 7.5 billion pounds. She could also increase tax paid on dividends. INHERITANCE TAX A politically sensitive subject, past governments have avoided major reforms to inheritance tax, which is currently paid after only 4% of deaths, raising about 7.5 billion pounds per year. IHT is paid at a rate of 40% on the value of estates above a threshold of 325,000 pounds - which has not changed since 2009. There are additional allowances for transferring family homes to younger generations. The system has increasingly favoured wealthier families. The Institute for Fiscal Studies thinks 2.7 billion pounds could be raised by making some IHT allowances - which exempt assets like family businesses, farmland, woodland and pension savings - less generous. PENSION REFORMS Reeves could tweak pension tax reliefs to raise more money - such as the tax-free lump sum, which enables pensioners to withdraw 25% of their pension as cash without paying tax, up to a value of 268,275 pounds. The IFS estimates that removing this allowance completely could raise 5.5 billion pounds over the long run. She could also reduce the generosity of tax reliefs on pension contributions for higher-rate taxpayers, by introducing a flat rate instead. FUEL DUTY Tax paid on motor fuels has been frozen every year since 2011 - except for a temporary cut in 2022/23. Past governments had always in theory planned to raise fuel duty - flattering the outlook for the public finances - but in practice they never followed through, fearing a backlash from drivers. Economists have long criticised this as a fiscal charade which Reeves could end on Oct. 31, burnishing the government's green credentials in the process. In the March budget published by the previous Conservative government, the latest cancellation of the fuel duty rise cost more than 3 billion pounds in 2024/25. ($1 = 0.7792 pounds)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/columnfirms-pull-forward-debt-sales-to-avoid-us-election-bump-dolan-3545082,"By Mike Dolan LONDON (Reuters) -Corporate credit markets shrugged off last week's equity wobble, setting aside any anxiety about the wider economy, allowing even low-rated firms to raise new debt with ease. For many investors, so-called junk credit is the canary in the coalmine. It is the first to croak if the economy runs into trouble, and it can also amplify any distress by upping fears of cascading defaults, bankruptcies and job losses. But there are few if any signs of that fear right now, which underscores how widespread the 'soft landing' consensus is. This also suggests the equity hiccup we saw last week was more about pricey megacaps and Big Tech corrections than a fundamental worry about growth per se. In fact, default rates are falling again. Deutsche Bank points out that trailing 12-month defaults for dollar high-yield bonds fell in June to their lowest point in almost a year - to just 3.1%. The default rate of the weakest ""CCC""-rated segment fell for the third consecutive month to its lowest since July 2023. That's below the 4% average default rate of the past four decades and only marginally above the 2.9% average of the past century, according to (LON: ). Yield spreads - the U.S. junk bond borrowing premia over equivalent Treasuries - remain close to their two-year lows. At 353 basis points, they're almost 100bp below levels seen this time last year, and spreads on 'B' and 'BB' segments are the narrowest they have been since the banking and credit implosion 15 years ago. What's more, junk bonds are outperforming better-rated investment grade debt for the year to date. And that long-feared 'wall' of maturing debts next year now looks more like a jump-able hurdle, as many companies are having no trouble smoothing out their financing schedules. In fact, many have been able to raise enough new debt to clear the decks ahead of any market disturbance that could arise around the U.S. election later in the year. High yield debt issuers have raised $176 billion so far this year - which is almost 80% ahead of last year's pace. And the market has had no trouble absorbing this flood of issuance. This is partly because demand for high yield debt is high, but supply of new paper isn't. Credit analysts at giant asset manager BlackRock (NYSE: ) point out that while a ton of high yield debt has been issued this year, only a minimal amount of new money has been raised. A whopping 75% of new debt sales this year have been earmarked for refinancing, the highest level seen in the post-2008 era and more than 10 points above June 2023 levels. Highlighting this 'pull forward' in debt sales in both the high-yield and investment-grade markets, BlackRock strategists Amanda Lynam and Dominique Bly reckon management teams are targetting maturities as far out as late 2025 and even 2026 and are keen to avoid any fund-raising difficulties around year-end. ""Corporates may be looking to proactively raise liquidity and avoid potential volatility around certain events later this year - such as the U.S. election,"" they wrote. REASSURINGLY EXPENSIVE? Is the appetite sustainable? Falling rates without a recession is a powerful combination for anyone wanting to move out of cash and lock in high yields. Some even argue that if you want to avoid Treasuries due to outsize post-election fiscal risks, then corporate credit may be the best middle ground. But some strategists caution that August and September are seasonally unkind to credit markets. And there is a continual fine balance between falling interest rates and recession risks. ""Central banks are late – they usually are - making it important that the data hold up,"" Morgan Stanley's credit team told clients. But the U.S. investment bank remains positive and reckons ""moderate growth, moderating inflation, moderating policy and robust investor demand"" all justify the historical pricing for U.S. credit. ""Spreads should be 'expensive' given this backdrop, and we think they stay that way,"" they said. So while we may see a surge in volatility as the election nears, we're unlikely to see a similar spike in defaults. The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-japan-to-outline-bond-taper-plan-debate-rate-hike-timing-3544778,"By Leika Kihara and Takaya Yamaguchi TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan raised interest rates to levels unseen in 15 years and unveiled a detailed plan to slow its massive bond buying, taking another step towards phasing out a decade of huge stimulus. The rate hike, which dashed dominant market expectations for no change, was the largest since 2007 and came just months after the BOJ ended eight years of negative interest rates as the bank's chief seeks to dismantle his predecessor's unorthodox policies. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda did not rule out another hike this year and stressed the bank's readiness to keep raising borrowing costs to levels deemed neutral to the economy. The hawkish comments pushed the dollar below 151 yen for the first time since March, as markets awoke to the reality that Japan was finally eyeing a full-fledged rate hike cycle. Japan's shift to tighter monetary policy contrasts sharply with the broad swing to lower interest rates by other major economies, with the Federal Reserve expected to signal later on Wednesday that it will cut rates in September as U.S. price pressures moderate. ""If data shows economic conditions are on track, and if such data accumulates, we would of course take the next step,"" Ueda told a news conference, when asked about the chance of another rate hike this year. ""By raising rates from very low levels and adjusting the degree of stimulus gradually, we can avoid the risk of having to make big adjustments in a short period of time,"" he said. At the two-day meeting ending on Wednesday, the BOJ's board decided to raise the overnight call rate target to 0.25% from 0-0.1% in a 7-2 vote. The short-term policy rate is now the highest since 2008. The BOJ under Ueda has so far hiked rates by a combined 35 basis points in just four months. Wednesday's hike was the largest since a 25 basis point increase in February 2007, which was the last major policy tightening before a long era of massive monetary stimulus aimed at reflating sluggish consumer demand. In a sign Ueda was drawing a line under the ultra-loose policies of the past, the BOJ also decided on a quantitative tightening (QT) plan that would halve monthly bond buying to 3 trillion yen ($19.6 billion) as of January-March 2026. The measure would diminish the BOJ's $3.9 trillion balance sheet by up to 8%, the central bank said, a sign it was stepping back from a controversial era of bond buying that began in 2013 and is often blamed for distorting Japan's markets. The stakes are high for the BOJ. After buying bonds aggressively to reflate growth, the BOJ now owns roughly half of total Japanese government bonds (JGB) sold in the market. The central bank must tread cautiously in tapering to avoid upending markets accustomed to its huge presence, and triggering a spike in yields that would boost the cost of financing Japan's huge public debt. YEN PRESSURES The BOJ's decision comes as the Fed looks increasingly set on cutting rates, reversing the aggressive tightening cycle that drove up the dollar and caused a painful yen sell-off for Japan. Ueda identified the weak yen as a risk to the BOJ's inflation projections and said the 0.5% threshold posed no barrier to rates going even higher, if needed. His comments helped pushed the yen up more than 1% to an intraday high of 150.61 per dollar on Wednesday. Short-term bond yields scaled 15-year peaks and Japanese bank shares soared, helping the share average reverse earlier declines. ""Despite sluggish consumer spending, monetary officials sent a decisive signal by raising interest rates and allowing for a more gradual balance sheet reduction,"" said Fred Neumann, chief Asia economist at HSBC. ""Rising inflation expectations also open the path for ongoing monetary policy normalisation by the BOJ. Barring major disruptions, the BOJ is on course to tighten further, with another interest hike by the start of next year,"" he said. In a quarterly outlook report released on Wednesday, the BOJ roughly maintained its projection made in April that inflation would stay around 2% through fiscal 2026. But the BOJ said import prices were again accelerating despite some recent moderation, stressing the need to be vigilant to the risk of an overshoot in inflation. The BOJ also warned that inflation may be more affected by yen moves than before, signaling its alarm over building inflationary pressure from the currency's declines. ""Although the BOJ had explained all along that monetary policy was not about targeting currencies, the weak yen must have been a major factor behind today's decision given that it was dealing a blow to small firms in rural regions,"" said Izuru Kato, chief economist at Totan Research.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/zelenskiy-signs-law-allowing-ukraine-debt-payment-suspension-3545490,"KYIV (Reuters) - Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelenskiy has signed a law allowing the government to suspend foreign debt payments until Oct. 1, paving the way for a moratorium to be called that would formally mark a sovereign default. Earlier this month, Ukraine announced a preliminary deal with a committee of its main bondholders to restructure its near $20 billion worth of international debt. Prompted by Russia's 2022 full-scale invasion, it will be its second such rework in a decade following a similar deal after the 2014 invasion of Crimea. A two-year payment moratorium on those bonds expires on Aug. 1. Bondholders still must approve the deal, which they are expected to do, though the technicalities behind it could take weeks. But a short-term default would have a less significant impact on its long-term borrowing prospects than a default with no deal in sight. The proposal would see a 37% nominal haircut on Ukraine's outstanding international bonds, saving Kyiv $11.4 billion in payments over the next three years - the duration of the country's programme with the International Monetary Fund, according to government statements. Ukraine also owes a $34 million coupon payment on its 2026 Eurobond due on Aug. 1, with a 10-day grace period. Ukraine's finance minister Sehriy Marchenko earlier hailed the deal with bondholders. But he also told RBC-Ukraine outlet that the negotiations were not easy, citing ""significant differences"" in the assessment of the situation Ukraine finds itself in."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/tougher-us-credit-conditions-may-help-pave-feds-ratecut-path-3545414,"By Ann Saphir (Reuters) - Benign inflation data and a cooling job market aside, U.S. credit conditions featuring tepid loan demand and stiff terms may also be bolstering confidence among Federal Reserve officials that price pressures are set to ease further, paving the way for interest rate cuts in coming months. U.S. central bankers will have the latest readings from a quarterly survey of bank loan officers in hand as they weigh monetary policy at a rate-setting meeting that wraps up on Wednesday. Although that report won't be made public until Monday, analysts say other available data suggests it will show the same pattern as in recent quarters: Weakening demand for loans from consumers and businesses alongside tightening credit standards from lenders emblematic of an economy losing steam but not at the kind of accelerating pace that points to an approaching recession. ""I think they like where credit conditions are - they like to see this slackening of demand, they like to see that banks have tightened a lot"" as borrowing costs have risen, said Warren Kornfeld, a banking credit analyst at Moody's (NYSE: ). The lending survey data Fed officials saw in conjunction with last July's policy meeting showed conditions then at their most stringent in years - and demand at the weakest - across mostly all categories of credit for households and businesses. Kornfeld said loan demand more recently is still cooling, and credit conditions are tightening, but less sharply than before, meaning conditions are ""getting closer to a neutral state,"" he said. ""It's all set up at this point in time for a 'soft landing,'"" referring to a scenario in which the Fed tames inflation without triggering a painful recession or sharp rise in unemployment. LOAN GROWTH SLOWDOWN The Fed's rate hiking campaign, begun in March of 2022, prompted a rise in lending standards and slowdown in loan growth. Those trends continued even after the central bank's last rate hike in July of 2023, but with less intensity than before. Other data show that loan growth for most uses has slowed but not reversed course. Meanwhile, demand for loans may actually be on the rise in some parts of the country. ""The big picture is a soft landing on the bank credit side as well as the real side: still tight, but not tightening as quickly as before,"" said Derek Tang, an economist at forecasting firm LH Meyer. The longer the Fed waits to lower the policy rate, though, the more anxious they will become over possible cracks ""because recessions are nonlinear and hard to stop once they start,"" he said. The cracks are hard to see so far, particularly on the real-economy side, with unemployment, at 4.1%, higher than it has been since the Fed's rate hikes began but still low by historical standards, and inflation coming down slowly toward the Fed's 2% goal. The U.S. household debt delinquency rate rose to 3.2% during the first quarter versus 3.1% in the final three months of last year, New York Fed data shows. That's below the 4.7% seen at the end of 2019 before the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. Still, credit-card borrowers who have reached their borrowing limits - this group tends to be disproportionately younger and lower-income - have seen a particularly sharp rise in delinquency rates, New York Fed researchers found. ""It does seem as though lower-income households are more strained in their personal finances and that will have a ripple effect,"" Tang said. ""September would not be too late to start easing the policy rate; actual interest rates will start to fall beforehand and this way the Fed can be a bit more sure about inflation before it begins."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/doubleline-sounds-alarm-on-us-government-debt-spiralling-higher-3545434,"By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - Higher debt payments and the possibility of a U.S. recession over the next 10 years could boost U.S. debt levels beyond recent forecasts and weigh on economic growth, an analyst at investment firm DoubleLine said. The U.S. government has expanded deficit spending during economic downturns over the past century, but since 2016 deficits have increased despite continued economic expansion and low unemployment, said Ryan Kimmel, a macro asset allocation analyst at DoubleLine. This raises the risk of deeper debt-funded deficits in case of an economic contraction, he said. ""There's finite demand for available capital out there to fund government debt issuance, and the only way you're going to entice demand for government bonds is through higher rates,"" Kimmel said. ""Your interest expense goes up, which requires higher taxes, which then crimps economic growth, which again feeds through into further economic contraction ... it's a vicious spiral."" The warning from DoubleLine, a bond-focused firm managing $92 billion in assets, comes amid rising concerns in the bond market over the U.S. fiscal trajectory ahead of the November presidential election, despite Democrats and Republicans vowing to reduce deficit spending. Rating agency Fitch last year downgraded the country's debt while Moody's (NYSE: ) lowered its outlook on the U.S. credit rating. The International Monetary Fund last month said the U.S. should curb rising debt levels. DoubleLine's CEO Jeffrey Gundlach, often dubbed ""the bond king,"" said in May he anticipates an eventual restructuring of U.S. Treasuries because of the growing debt burden. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office last month revised its deficit forecasts to reflect higher spending, but even the latest projections may be too optimistic, Kimmel said in a report this week. The CBO estimated the ratio of debt to gross domestic product (GDP), a key metric of a country's fiscal health, to climb to over 122% by 2034, up from 99% this year. It projects the average interest rate on outstanding federal debt to remain at around 3.5% for the next 10 years, which is below current Treasury yields above 4% and the Federal Reserve's policy rate, currently 5.25%-5.5%. In hypothetical scenarios with average interest rates of 4%, 5%, and 6% over the next 10 years, Kimmel calculated debt-to-GDP could spike to 126%, 136% and 147%, respectively, by 2034. Neither CBO's estimates nor Kimmel's assume a recession over the next 10 years, which could exacerbate the debt burden. Higher government borrowing would push investors to demand more compensation, lifting borrowing costs in various economic sectors, said Kimmel. Markets had a taste of that in October last year, when so-called bond vigilantes, investors who punish profligate governments by selling their bonds, pushed Treasury prices to 17-year lows. One way to avoid these outcomes would be reducing fiscal deficits by trimming government spending, he said. ""While politically challenging, exercising fiscal restraint remains a viable option ... A key question is, will politicians act before U.S. debt dynamics unravel into an unsustainable condition for the economy?"""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fed-decision-boj-microsoft-meta-platforms--whats-moving-markets-3545208,"Investing.com -- The Bank of Japan hiked interest rates earlier Wednesday, putting the focus on the Federal Reserve, which concludes its July meeting later in the session. Wall Street looks set to end the month on a positive note as investors digest earnings from the likes of Microsoft. 1. BOJ hikes, and the Fed is next… The started the week’s central bank parade earlier Wednesday, raising interest rates and signaling its resolve to unwind a decade of massive monetary stimulus. The Japanese central bank hiked its overnight call rate target to 0.25% from 0-0.1% by a 7-2 vote and laid out a detailed quantitative tightening plan that will reduce monthly bond buying in several stages to around Y3 trillion, half the current rough target, by early 2026. Wednesday's rate hike comes amid some improvements in Japanese inflation over the past two months, especially as consumer spending improved on stronger wages. This trend furthered the central bank’s forecast that inflation will climb to its 2% annual target sustainably, and that monetary conditions will have to tighten accordingly. In the U.S., by contrast, a benign June inflation report has investors looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut. The concludes its July meeting later Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July. Futures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas. 2. Futures rise as investors digest corporate results U.S. stock futures rose Wednesday as investors awaited the conclusion of the latest Federal Reserve meeting while parsing through a series of important earnings reports. By 04:10 ET (08:10 GMT), the contract was 77 points, or 0.2%, higher, climbed 42 points, or 0.8%, and rose by 252 points, or 1.3%. The Federal Reserve concludes its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year. There are more earnings to digest Wednesday, including from Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: ) [see below] after the close. Other names set to release numbers include Boeing (NYSE: ) before the bell, as well as Qualcomm (NASDAQ: ), Etsy (NASDAQ: ) and (NYSE: ) later on. This is the final session of July, and both the and are on course to end the month lower, with the latter seen losing over 3%. The , on the other hand, is on track to finish the month higher by more than 4%, as the market rotated out of the major tech stocks into companies that are smaller and more cyclically oriented. 3. Microsoft’s cloud growth disappoints Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) disappointed with its fourth-quarter update after the close Tuesday, as the tech giant indicated it would spend more money on artificial intelligence infrastructure, even as growth slowed in its cloud business. This offered another sign that the payoff from hefty investments in the technology may take longer than Wall Street had hoped. Microsoft's cloud business, Azure, which is widely viewed as a barometer for AI demand, grew 29%, marking a slowdown from 31% growth seen in the previous quarter. Additionally, AI-related growth accounted for about 8% of Azure's total growth, up from 7% in the third quarter. However, this came as Microsoft continued to ramp up investments, with capital spending jumping to $19 billion in the quarter, up from $14 billion in the prior quarter, and nearly double the $10.7 billion seen a year ago. It wasn’t all bad news for the sector though, as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: ) increased its 2024 forecast for artificial intelligence chip sales by $500 million and said supplies would remain tight through 2025. 4. Meta expected to see jump in revenue Meta Platforms is the latest of the mega-cap tech giants to release quarterly results this week, with the numbers due after the close Wednesday. Meta, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp, among other products and services, is expected to report a 20% rise in quarterly revenue, helped by strong ad sales driven by the Olympics and elections in several countries. However, like fellow tech giants Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) and Microsoft, investors will want to see if the billions it is spending on tech infrastructure to support AI development is starting to yield returns. ""We remain positive on Meta and think Reels, Messaging and AI-driven ad improvements are still early, and could lead to positive product surprises and revenue upside,"" analysts at BofA Securities said. ""With political spend, and potential TikTok ban in 1Q'25, Meta could also see an ad spend benefit in 2H'24."" 5. Crude prices rise on elevated political tensions Crude prices soared Wednesday after the killing of Hamas leader Ismail Haniyeh in Iran ratcheted up tensions in the Middle East, raising the prospects of a wider conflict hitting supplies. By 04:10 ET, the futures (WTI) climbed 1.8% to $76.08 a barrel, while the contract rose 1.7% to $79.38 a barrel. Multiple media reports said that Ismail Haniyeh was killed in an Israeli strike, and could mean a potential escalation in the Israel-Hamas war, which stretched into a ninth month in July. It could also result in a resurgence in tensions between Iran and Israel, after a series of missile strikes between the two earlier this year, and furthered fears of an all-out war in the Middle East, especially after Israel carried out strikes against Lebanon-based, Iran-backed armed group Hezbollah on Tuesday. This news has overshadowed data from the showing on Tuesday that U.S. inventories saw a draw of nearly 4.5 million barrels last week. The reading marked a fifth straight week of draws in U.S. inventories, as fuel demand remained underpinned by the travel-heavy summer season."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/world-bank-approves-1-billion-in-financing-for-ethiopia-3544353,"(Reuters) -The World Bank's board has approved $1.5 billion in financing for its first ever budget support lending to Ethiopia, the lender said late on Tuesday as the east African nation tries to push ahead with a long-running debt restructuring. Africa's second-most populous country secured a four-year, $3.4 billion programme from the International Monetary Fund on Monday, hours after its central bank floated its birr currency, paving the way for its debt overhaul to move forward. The World Bank will provide a grant of $1 billion and another $500 million in a low interest credit line, part of the first ever direct budgetary support facility provided to Ethiopia, the global lender said. ""This policy operation supports home-grown reforms that will ultimately help the country transition to a more inclusive economy that allows the private sector to contribute more strongly to growth,"" the World Bank said.    The bank plans to ""provide around $6 billion in new commitments over the next three fiscal years and support economic reforms through fast-disbursing budget support,"" it said. The funding is part of a $10.7 billion financing package by the IMF, World Bank and other creditors, according to Ethiopian officials. The financial support, however, was conditional on the government implementing significant economic reforms, including the liberalisation of the foreign currency market. Ethiopia's birr was down 3% against the dollar early on Wednesday, trading at 77.13. It was little changed on Tuesday after tumbling 30% on the day it was floated on Monday. Ethiopia sought to restructure its sovereign debt in 2021, under the G20 Common Framework initiative to offer relief to developing nations, but progress was slowed by a civil war in the northern region of Tigray that ended the following year. Ethiopia's winding debt restructuring mirrors that of Chad and Zambia which completed their debt overhauls under the Common Framework. Ghana, another African country saddled with high debt, is nearing the finish line of its own restructuring under the initiative. Ethiopia's development partners have welcomed its move to a market-based foreign exchange rate, but some analysts have said the move could drive up inflation and the cost of living, especially for its poorest residents. The country of 126.5 million people also faces a number of other challenges, including the impact of climate change and the post-war reconstruction of Tigray."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/boj-governor-uedas-comments-at-news-conference-3545126,"(Reuters) -The Bank of Japan raised interest rates in a mostly unexpected move on Wednesday and unveiled a detailed plan to slow its massive bond buying, taking another step towards phasing out a decade of huge stimulus. Following are excerpts from BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda's comments at his post-meeting news conference, which was conducted in Japanese, as translated by Reuters: CONSUMPTION ""While rising prices may have affected consumption, it is moving on a firm note. Household sentiment is showing signs of bottoming out. Wage data has also shown rising pay. Our surveys also showed wage hikes broadening among smaller firms. We expect wage hikes to spread further, and underpin consumption and inflation."" INFLATION ""We've also confirmed rises in services prices. We expect a moderate cycle of rising wages and inflation to continue. The weak yen is also pushing up import prices, so we need to be vigilant to the risk of an inflation overshoot. ""Even though we raised rates, real interest rates remain low. Our move won't affect the economy much."" RATE HIKES ""If the economy and prices move in line with our projection, we will continue to raise interest rates. In fact, we haven't changed much our projection from April. We don't see 0.5% as any key barrier when raising rates."" ON WHETHER THE BOJ COULD RAISE RATES AGAIN THIS YEAR ""That depends on upcoming data. If conditions move in line with our forecast, or overshoot our forecast, we could raise interest rates further. ""By raising rates from very low levels and adjusting the degree of stimulus gradually, we can avoid the risk of having to make big adjustments in a short period of time. ""There is still a lot of uncertainty on where Japan's natural rate of interest is. What we can say is that short-term rates are still pretty much below levels that could raise questions about whether we're close to the neutral level."" WEAK YEN AND INFLATION ""The yen has weakened since the start of this year, but we haven't changed our consumer inflation forecasts that much. The weakening yen hasn't changed our forecasts in a significant way. But there's quite a significant risk of the weak yen leading to an overshoot of inflation."" ON WHAT DATA WOULD BE IN FOCUS IN RATE-HIKE DECISION ""It won't change much from before. Wage hikes and their impact on services inflation, as well as inflation expectations, are important. We are also looking at overall demand and the output gap. We'll also scrutinise the impact of our rate hike on the economy. We'll look at a wide range of data. ""We don't have a pre-set idea in mind on the pace of future interest rate hikes. We'll look at various data and once we have a collective view on developments, and judge that economic and price conditions are in line with our forecast, we'll take action. It's hard to say when that would be."" ON WHETHER ANOTHER RATE HIKE BY YEAR-END IS NOT RULED OUT ""If data shows conditions are on track, and if such data accumulates, we would of course take the next step."" NEUTRAL LEVEL OF RATES ""We don't have a specific image on the neutral level of rates. But we won't reach that level for quite some time. We haven't narrowed down much the neutral level of rates yet, so we don't have a path laid down. We'll have to think about it as we go."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/germany-leaves-womens-labour-power-untapped-3545157,"By Maria Martinez BERLIN (Reuters) - With a rapidly ageing population, Germany is urgently looking at how it can get more work from a labour force that enjoys the most ample leisure time in the rich world. But analysts say it is overlooking one vital, untapped resource: its women. Government measures announced this month include tax incentives to encourage overtime and later retirement, plus a 2-billion-euro ($2.2 billion) investment in childcare to help more mothers into the workplace. But even with that, labour market experts say the package does not go nearly far enough to address deep-rooted obstacles in the tax system and longstanding cultural norms which are still keeping many women at home. ""For me the big missed opportunity was to really think much more seriously about how we can incentivise women to work more,"" Nicola Fuchs-Schuendeln, Chair for Macroeconomics and Development at the Goethe University Frankfurt, told Reuters. Germany's ageing demographics mean its labour force is shrinking by 400,000 workers a year in what Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government acknowledges is a major long-term threat to Europe's largest economy and its public finances. Foreign workers have been a major piece of Germany's workforce for decades and the coalition aims to make it easier for migrants to enter the job market with measures including tax incentives for skilled workers and work permits for refugees. However, with a national election next year and the anti-immigrant Alternative for Germany polling in second place, the politics around migrant workers is changing shape, prompting a search for alternatives. The challenge is significant. According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, average annual hours per worker in Germany stood at 1,343 in 2023 - the lowest among the 38 advanced economies in the OECD club. Enzo Weber, researcher at the Institute for Employment Research, said although participation by women and students in the German labour market is high, much of it is part-time, decreasing the average hours per worker. European Union data show that while labour force participation by German women is better than in most EU countries, 47% of them work part-time - well above the bloc's average of 28%. ""Our high labour market participation rate does not compensate for these low working hours,"" said Holger Schaefer, senior economist at the German think tank IW. ""As a result, we make less use of our labour force potential than most other countries."" One reason for this goes back decades. In 1958, the then-West Germany introduced a tax benefit for married couples to reflect the status of marriage and family in the constitution. A couple is taxed as a single unit. In practice, this means many women end up being taxed at the marginal rate of their partner - lowering the incentive to work in couples where the man is the top earner. A second factor is so-called ""mini-jobs"", created in the labour reforms of the 2000s which exempt from tax any job paying a monthly wage of 538 euros or less. Around 4.3 million women in Germany have a mini-job. But if they increase their hours - and hence wages - taxation and social contributions kick in, taking a chunk out of earnings. Thirdly Germany, like other countries, has an acute lack of childcare - in its case an estimated shortfall of 400,000 places. ""The shortage of pre- and post-school childcare places may be a more significant barrier to part-time parents increasing their hours in Germany than elsewhere,"" said Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics. UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES Some analysts have raised concerns that the new measures could unintentionally create further barriers for women. There will be tax incentives for full-time workers - who are mostly men - to increase their working hours. ""If men even increase their full time further by two or three hours, then the margin for women in the partnership to work becomes even smaller,"" said Weber of the Institute for Employment Research. On top of these economic factors come social and cultural ones which may prove equally difficult to address. While studies show most people in Europe would work less if they could, German workers - with average net earnings of 38,000 euros per year compared to the EU average of 28,200 - are simply more able to do so if they choose. Conservative social norms, particularly in West Germany, according to which a child is better off being cared for by the mother, also play a role. While 45% of mothers in East Germany work full-time - an after-effect of the German Democratic Republic which upheld the model of the working mother - only 19% of West German mothers do, an IW study shows. The labour package includes incentives for employers to pay bonuses to employees who expand their part-time hours, but economists doubt this will sway those women with the financial means to prioritise their free time. When Jennifer Hart, a 38-year-old government adviser, returned to work after her baby was born, she began with 50% of full time hours, increasing to 32 hours per week when her child was one and a half. The salary cut was substantial and her main worry is that she is also paying less into her pension. Women in Germany receive a third of the retirement income of their male counterparts, in what has been called the ""gender pension gap."" One in five women aged 65 or over is at risk of poverty in Germany, compared with 17.5% of the men, according to statistics office data. But still, Hart said increasing her working hours is not an option while her child is still young. ""Part time to me is a choice to spend more time with my kid and make logistics around day care possible,"" she told Reuters. ""I doubt taxes can change that."" ($1 = 0.9211 euros)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bond-investors-see-dovish-hold-from-fed-pile-on-yield-curve-steepeners-3543355,"By Gertrude Chavez-Dreyfuss NEW YORK (Reuters) - Bond investors, expecting the Federal Reserve to hold interest rates steady this week but signal that rate cuts are imminent, are betting that the U.S. Treasury yield curve will become less inverted and eventually return to a normal positive slope. The strategy involves bullish bets on short-dated Treasuries and reducing longer-dated exposure, a trade referred to as a ""steepener"" which pushes yields on longer-dated Treasuries higher than short-term maturities. Investors are compensated with a higher yield for taking risk over a longer period. The widely watched two-year/10-year yield curve has been inverted for two years, the longest inversion in history, with the gap in yield at minus 22 basis points (bps). With the focus on the yield curve, the Federal Reserve is widely anticipated on Wednesday, at the end of its two-day policy meeting, to keep its benchmark overnight rate in the 5.25%-5.50% range for an eighth straight meeting. Investors expect a ""dovish hold"" from Fed Chair Jerome Powell's press conference at the end of the meeting, in which he is likely to signal that rates will be lowered as soon as September for the first time in more than four years. Powell also has the Jackson Hole gathering of central bankers in late August to prepare the market for a rate cut. By then more data on inflation and this Friday's July employment report could give policy makers the confidence they seek. The rate futures market has priced in about 68 bps of total cuts this year starting in September, LSEG calculations showed, a big jump from 30 bps just before the June meeting. Roughly three more cuts of 25 bps each are expected by June 2025. In the Fed's June rate forecasts the central bank had penciled in just one cut in 2024. Easing U.S. inflation and a gradually slackening labor market have prompted a shift in rate expectations. ""The yield curve moved a significant amount in the last six weeks, but we are at these levels in October last year and it still comes down to an inverted curve, which is not normal,"" said Greg Wilensky, head of U.S. fixed income at Janus Henderson Investors, with assets under management of $352.6 billion. ""We're going into a situation where the curve moves to a normal positive slope. There is plenty of room for it to go."" BULL STEEPENERS The spread between two-year and 10-year yields has narrowed by 30.4 bps since late June. The curve the last few weeks has mainly seen ""bull steepeners,"" where short-term yields have fallen more sharply than longer-dated ones, a typical prelude to the Fed's starting an easing cycle. Investors had bet aggressively in January on a steeper yield curve, as the markets priced in multiple rate cuts for 2024 after a dovish pivot from the Fed in December. But those bets unraveled and the curve flattened even more as short-term yields surged above long-term ones amid a surprisingly durable economy and pesky inflation. Going into this week's Fed meeting, investors in the futures market sharply increased net long bets on short-dated Treasuries, such as U.S. two-year notes, while net long positions on longer maturities have not risen as much or have declined. That mirrored bull steepeners that have been in place the last few weeks. Friday's data from the Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed asset managers last week increased their net long position on U.S. two year notes to a record high. Asset managers have also remained net long on U.S. 5-year note futures, hitting an all-time peak in mid-July before slipping a bit last week, ""There is an urgency to get into the short end of the curve before yields start to fall in a more pronounced way,"" said Chip Hughey, managing director of fixed income at Truist Advisory Services in Richmond, Virginia. Net longs from institutional investors on U.S. 10-year futures were largely flat last week. ""If the Fed starts its cutting cycle without a recession, buying any duration, or any longer bonds, won't necessarily give you the same impact of being on the right part of the curve, like the 2s to 7s,"" said Mike Sanders, portfolio manager and head of fixed income at Madison Investments in Madison, Wisconsin. The firm, with $25 billion in assets, is currently overweight U.S. three-year to seven-year Treasuries, reflecting expectations their yields will fall."

At the two-day policy meeting that ended on Wednesday, the central bank also laid out a detailed quantitative tightening plan that will reduce monthly bond buying in several stages to around 3 trillion yen ($19.6 billion) as of January-March 2026.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/china-will-implement-consumption-tax-reform-stepbystep-vice-finance-minister-says-3545006,"BEIJING (Reuters) -China will gradually implement consumption tax reform through different items and standardise management of local governments' non-tax revenues, Vice Finance Minister Wang Dongwei said at a press conference in Beijing on Wednesday. Local administrations will gradually be allowed to retain more of the consumption tax, which is currently collected by the central government and accounts for almost a tenth of China's total tax revenues, according to a Communist Party agenda-setting meeting this month known as a plenum. China currently collects consumption taxes based on the value of a good when it is produced but there are plans to widen the assessment of the tax to include the value at its consumption. Wang said in his remarks to media outlining government steps to enact policy made at the plenum that ""we are considering moving the consumption tax collection stage backwards"". ""We will consider the division of central and local government revenues and their tax collection and administration capabilities, and steadily implement the reform by different product items step-by-step, in a bid to expand local governments' revenue sources and guide them to improve consumption environment,"" said Wang. China is attempting to overhaul its tax regime, under which the central government gets most revenues but saddles local authorities with most expenditures, as municipalities are making less income form land sales amid a prolonged property crisis. Policymakers also hope to ease concerns over municipal debt of more than $13 trillion that poses risks to the financial system. Official data on Wednesday showed China's manufacturing activity in July shrank for a third month, highlighting the still sluggish domestic demand. At a key policy meeting on economy held on Tuesday, Chinese leaders signalled the stimulus measures needed to reach this year's economic growth target will be directed at consumers. The state planner and finance ministry said last week some funds raised through this year's ultra-long sovereign bonds issuance would be shifted towards supporting a consumer goods trade-in scheme."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/boj-hikes-interest-rates-by-15-bps-to-halve-bond-purchases-by-2026-3545021,"Investing.com-- The Bank of Japan raised interest rates by 15 basis points on Wednesday and said it will gradually halve its pace of monthly bond purchases by 2026 as it winds down its ultra-dovish policy and quantitative easing measures. The BOJ hiked its benchmark by 15 basis points to a range of 0.1% to 0.25%. Market expectations were split between a hold and a potential hike of 10-15 basis points. The central bank said it will reduce its pace of Japanese Government Bond purchases to 3 trillion yen ($19.59 billion) from its current pace of 6 trillion yen by early-2026, in line with general consensus. The BOJ said it will reduce its pace of JGB buying by 400 billion yen each quarter. The BOJ’s move to reduce its QE measures was mostly telegraphed by the bank during its June meeting. BOJ members were seen lowering their outlook for economic growth and inflation in the near-term. A median of BOJ member forecasts for real gross domestic product in fiscal 2024 to 0.6% from 0.8%, and while the outlook for core consumer price index inflation fell to 2.5% from 2.8% for the year. Still, BOJ members were seen slightly hiking their outlook for core CPI in 2025, to 2.1% from 1.9%. The Japanese yen weakened slightly after the decision, with the pair- which gauges the amount of yen needed to buy one dollar- rising 0.3%. Weakness in the yen came as some traders were disappointed with the BOJ’s extended timeline in winding down its QE measures, as well as its soft near-term outlook for the Japanese economy. Wednesday's rate hike comes amid some improvements in Japanese inflation over the past two months, especially as consumer spending improved on stronger wages. This trend furthered the central bank’s forecast that inflation will reach its 2% annual target sustainably, and that monetary conditions will have to tighten accordingly. This forecast had driven the BOJ’s first rate hike in 17 years in March, where it brought rates into positive territory after nearly a decade of ultra-loose policy. Other data released on Wednesday showed some improvement in Japan’s economy, with rising more than expected in June, while shrank less than expected. Still, the Japanese economy was nursing a sharp contraction in the first quarter of 2024, which raised doubts over just how much headroom the BOJ has to tighten policy further."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/reserve-bank-of-india-to-hold-rates-in-august-first-cut-in-q4-reuters-poll-3545003,"By Anant Chandak and Devayani Sathyan BENGALURU (Reuters) - The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) will keep interest rates steady for a ninth straight meeting in August due to persistently high inflation, with a slim majority of economists in a Reuters poll expecting the first rate cut next quarter. A sharp spike in food prices drove inflation in Asia's third-largest economy to a five-month high of 5.08% in June, well above the RBI's 4% medium-term target, suggesting the central bank will be wary of easing monetary policy too soon. With gross domestic product (GDP) growth of around 8% over the past few years - the fastest among major world economies - and inflation not expected to fall to 4% anytime soon, the RBI has little reason to rush an interest rate cut. All 59 economists in the latest Reuters poll predicted the RBI would hold the repo rate at 6.50% at the conclusion of its August 6-8 meeting. It was the first rates survey taken after the July 23 budget, in which the government kept borrowing targets in check. ""We still believe the RBI will keep rates on hold at the upcoming meeting...but expect to see a first rate cut in Q4. With the headline number picking up again in June, inflation has remained too high for policymakers to consider a dovish move just yet,"" said Alexandra Hermann, lead economist at Oxford Economics. ""Given economic growth momentum is still strong, the RBI faces less of a trade-off between inflation and growth and can hence keep interest rates higher for longer to rein in inflation without risking to cause cracks in the economy."" Inflation was expected to average 4.5% this fiscal year and next, according to a separate Reuters poll. It has remained above the central bank's mid-point target of 4.0% for nearly five years. All respondents said any easing would come later than a first rate reduction from the U.S. Federal Reserve, expected in September. The median forecast from the poll showed a first cut of 25 basis points to 6.25% next quarter - a view held since May, and more dovish than financial markets pricing of no reduction this fiscal year, which ends in March 2025. A 57% majority said a first cut would come in Q4, but there was no majority on where the repo rate would end the year. Nearly half of the economists surveyed, 25 of 54, expected 6.25% at year-end, 23 predicted it would remain said 6.50%, five said 6.00%, and just one forecast 6.35%. While a smaller number of forecasters provided rate views well into next year, medians showed no cut beyond 6.00%. All respondents said any easing would come later than a first rate reduction from the U.S. Federal Reserve, expected in September. ""We still need to see how things pan out because a September cut by the Fed doesn't necessarily translate into an October cut by the RBI,"" said Kunal Kundu, India economist at Societe Generale (OTC: ). ""If the growth potential is indeed higher, there is less necessity for the RBI to cut the policy rate."""

The small Caribbean island nation had a gross domestic product (GDP) of about $1.3 billion last year, according to World Bank data. In 2004, Hurricane Ivan caused Grenada to suffer losses that doubled its GDP. Mitchell cautioned that the estimate was still preliminary, and that besides devastating homes and farms, Beryl had wrought destruction on electricity grids, mangrove forests, water infrastructure and the fishing sector."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/china-politburo-meeting-offers-few-stimulus-cues-focus-on-implementation-citi-3544982,"Investing.com-- China’s Politburo held its July meeting on Tuesday, with the country’s top officials reiterating the country’s annual economic growth target, and that they would roll out more stimulus measures aimed at consumers. The meeting marked some deviation from Chinese authorities’ usual playbook of focusing on infrastructure, with analysts at Citi noting an explicit emphasis on consumption. But while the focus on consumption is a positive development, Citi said that China’s stance towards stimulus had still not extended beyond “generally reactive” measures and incremental easing. Citi also flagged a lack of concrete measures to boost household income and sentiment. The brokerage said that Beijing had provided few details on its plans to support the property market, which has been a key pain point for the Chinese economy in recent years. Citi said that the meeting did not mark any major shift in China’s stance on stimulus, and that market focus was now on how Beijing will implement more supportive measures for  the economy. “Follow-up policy implementation is critically important in the coming months. For the time being, without major policy shifts, investor confidence would likely remain soft,” Citi analysts wrote in a note. Analysts at Morgan Stanley echoed this notion, stating that they remained cautious over China’s plan for stimulus, noting that while last year’s July meeting had also promised more supportive policies, it had yielded only “piecemeal measures in a reactive fashion.” The Politburo is a top decision-making body of the Chinese Communist Party, with its July meeting setting the tone for China’s economy in the remainder of 2024. But the meeting offered few actual cues on stimulus measures, coming shortly after the CCP’s third Plenum, which also gave scant details on more planned measures. Sentiment towards China has grown increasingly negative in recent months, sparking a rout in local stocks as Beijing gave few actual cues on stimulus measures, even as the economy grew less than expected in the second quarter."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/biden-lula-to-discuss-venezuela-election-on-tuesday-sources-say-3543441,"By Lisandra Paraguassu BRASILIA (Reuters) -Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and U.S. President Joe Biden said on Tuesday they agreed the Venezuelan government must quickly publish the vote tallies of Sunday's contested election to end the crisis in the oil-producing country. ""The two leaders agreed on the need for immediate release of full, transparent, and detailed voting data,"" the White House said in a statement. A Brazilian official who listened in to the 30-minute call requested by the White House said Lula insisted that both countries wait for the release of the tallies before taking a final position on the election. ""The conversation showed Brazil and the United States have similar positions that access to the vote tallies is indispensable,"" the source said. In Venezuela, protesters took to streets, waving flags and demanding President Nicolas Maduro acknowledge he lost Sunday's election to an opposition that claimed it clinched a landslide victory. In Washington, the Biden administration said electoral manipulation had stripped Maduro's claim of reelection victory of ""any credibility,"" and Washington left the door open to fresh sanctions on the OPEC nation. Venezuela must release vote tallies to ""resolve the dispute,"" Lula said in an interview with a TV Globo affiliate, adding that if they confirmed Maduro's victory, that result would have to be recognized. Lula briefed Biden on the situation in Venezuela as reported to him by his former foreign minister Celso Amorim, his foreign affairs adviser whom he sent to Caracas to follow the election. The source said an open channel will continue between Brasilia and the White House on the Venezuelan crisis. Earlier, two Brazilian sources told Reuters the call was scheduled at the request of the U.S. government as it seeks Brazil's assessment of the election results in neighboring Venezuela. Venezuela's national electoral authority proclaimed Maduro winner of the weekend vote, giving him a third term in office, but the opposition has also claimed victory. Independent pollsters called Maduro's win implausible, as opposition leaders and foreign observers urged vote tallies to be released. Brazil's government on Monday hailed what it called a ""peaceful"" election day in Venezuela and said it was closely monitoring the vote count, waiting for electoral authorities to release vote tallies to ensure the legitimacy of results."
https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/us-house-committee-demands-esg-information-from-investors-3544387,"By Isla Binnie NEW YORK (Reuters) -The Republican leader of a U.S. congressional committee wrote on Tuesday to demand more than 130 investors explain their environmental, social and governance (ESG) goals, highlighting how his party's scrutiny of such initiatives is continuing. Judiciary Committee Chair Jim Jordan, who penned the letters, has warned money managers that collective pledges to drive down greenhouse gas emissions might violate antitrust law. The Democratic minority on the committee disagrees, reflecting a broader partisan split on the issue. Republican ire has landed forcefully upon alliances that formed around corporate commitments to help combat climate change, partly driven by fears of job losses in the fossil fuel industry. One of those groups is Climate Action 100+, which boasts around 700 signatories. The committee's letters pertain to Climate Action 100+'s push for companies to implement plans to deal with the energy transition. Each recipient was asked what requests they will make of companies in their portfolio, and was told to preserve ""all documents and communications referring or relating to the company's efforts to advance ESG-related goals"". A representative for climate-focused investor group Ceres, which co-founded Climate Action 100+, said ""tens of thousands of documents"" had already been produced for the committee and the letters were ""unlikely to gather any new information"". No antitrust lawsuit has been brought against any climate coalition, but Jordan's committee claims responsibility for the decisions taken by several asset managers to end their membership of the group for fear of a crackdown. ""These letters are another attempt to deter investors from participating in the initiative,"" the Ceres representative said. The committee has also interviewed former regulators as part of its antitrust probe. A rule passed by U.S. President Joe Biden, which itself overturned one put in place by his predecessor Donald Trump to limit socially conscious investing by employee retirement plans, is still being litigated in court."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/yellen-harris-vp-contender-shapiro-tout-irs-free-file-system-in-philadelphia-3544058,"By David Lawder PHILADELPHIA (Reuters) -U.S. Vice President and Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris would adhere to President Joe Biden's vow against raising taxes on middle-income Americans and helped formulate Biden-Harris administration proposals to raise taxes on the wealthy and on corporations, U.S. Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen said on Tuesday. But Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, a contender to be Harris' running mate in the November presidential election, touted his record of cutting taxes for businesses in the state. At an Internal Revenue Service event in Philadelphia, Yellen said that Harris, if elected, would likely pursue a number of Biden's economic priorities, including support for child care, family leave and an expanded Child Tax Credit. Asked whether Harris would adopt Biden's tax proposals, Yellen said: ""Vice President Harris has indicated her support for avoiding tax increases for middle-income families. So I believe that's a principle that she would adhere to."" Yellen, however, declined to speculate on how Harris would approach negotiations in Congress in 2025, the year that Trump-era tax cuts expire. Shapiro said that Pennsylvania cut taxes for businesses because it needed to have a more competitive environment to grow jobs and attract businesses. State corporate taxes are slated to decline to 4.99% by 2031 from 8.99% in 2023. ""We also understood that we need to have a more advantageous tax environment for our businesses, and it was one component of an overall strategy in order to grow jobs and create more economic opportunity in Pennsylvania,"" Shapiro said. ""That's why I've been so aggressively working to cut business taxes and make sure that we have an environment here that works for business owners."" Yellen and Shapiro earlier announced that Pennsylvania will join the Internal Revenue Service's free direct filing system for simple tax returns next year, providing the option to as many as 1.5 million taxpayers in the state. The move follows a successful pilot program during the 2024 tax filing season in 12 states after which the IRS announced that it would offer a permanent free filing system, funded in part by $60 billion in new modernization funding for the IRS over a decade - funding that Republicans have vowed to rescind. Yellen said the pilot program attracted filings from 140,000 taxpayers - exceeding the 100,000 goal - who claimed more than $90 million in refunds and saved an estimated $5.6 million in fees that would have been charged by private tax preparers. Shapiro survived the first cut of Harris' shortlist, as North Carolina Governor Roy Cooper and Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer dropped out of that selection process. The Pennsylvania governor and former state attorney general is competing against Kentucky Governor Andy Beshear, U.S. Senator Mark Kelly of Arizona, Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, and Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. In the past year, Yellen has held events with Beshear, Kelly, Cooper and Whitmer touting Biden-Harris economic policies, from clean energy tax credits to investments in semiconductors."

""Despite the upside surprise to openings, all measures of labor market tightness edged down further, suggesting that underlying conditions have eased incrementally,"" Evercore ISI said in a Tuesday note, following data showing job openings fell to 8.18M in June from 8.23M in May, though beat economists estimates of 8.02M. Beyond the headline number, however, the broad set of measures of labor market tightness including the quits rate, vacancy-to-unemployed ratio, and hires rate dropped below pre-pandemic levels, consistent with cooling in the labor market. The quits rate, a gauge of labor market tightness, fell to 2.1% on a 3-month moving average, below the 2.3% recorded in February 2020. While the vacancies-to-unemployed ratio ""displayed similar dynamics, declining at the margin and remaining close to the pre-pandemic levels,"" Evercore ISI said. While the Fed has singled out an unexpected weakening in the labor market as a potential catalyst that will likely force it into action, Evercore ISI believes that it is ""encouraging that the labor market is not showing signs of rapid deterioration."" ""The latest release showed a decline in layoffs level and rate by -180k and -0.2p.p., respectively, continuing the trend of historically subdued layoffs observed during the post-pandemic labor market,"" it added. Further insight into the labor market will come later this week on Friday, when the Labor Department releases the nonfarm payrolls data for July. ""We expect a 165k increase in payrolls in July (vs. consensus 178K) and a flat 4.1% unemployment rate,"" Goldman Sachs said, noting that ""seasonally-adjusted job growth tends to accelerate in the summer when the labor market is tight."" The Fed kicked off its two-day meeting Tuesday and is expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday, but lay out the carpet for a September cut. ""We continue to expect a first cut in September followed by quarterly cuts,"" Goldman Sachs added in a recent note. We see the risks to the Fed path as tilted slightly to the downside of our baseline of quarterly cuts, though not quite as much as market pricing implies."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/uk-finance-minister-we-will-need-to-raise-taxes-in-october-budget-3544354,"LONDON (Reuters) - New British finance minister Rachel Reeves said on Tuesday she would need to raise taxes in her Oct. 30 budget, confirming expectations of such a move after she earlier this week set out a 22 billion pound shortfall in this year's budget. ""I think that we will have to increase taxes in the budget,"" said Reeves, who took control of the finance ministry following the Labour Party's resounding election win on July 4. She made the comments in an interview with The News Agents podcast. Reeves had previously stopped short of explicitly confirming that taxes would rise but had said ""difficult decisions"" would be needed in the budget, including on tax. She did not say which taxes would be increased, and repeated her commitment not to raise the rates of income tax, National Insurance social security payments, value-added tax and corporation tax. The tax increase will come on top of 13.5 billion pounds worth of spending cuts over the next two years that were announced on Monday. Reeves said the cuts were needed because the previous Conservative government had covered up the true state of the public finances. The Conservative Party, which was in power for the last 14 years, denies those accusations and says Labour had always planned to increase taxes."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/boj-considering-raising-shortterm-rates-to-around-025-jiji-reports-3544265,"TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan is considering raising short-term interest rates to around 0.25% from the current 0-0.1% at its two-day policy meeting that ends on Wednesday, Jiji news agency reported. Public broadcaster NHK also reported that the BOJ would consider raising interest rates, with many board members of the view that inflation is accelerating in line with their forecast. Citing an unidentified source, NHK said that the board members felt the BOJ must be vigilant regarding risks that the weak yen could push up inflation. Any such move would follow the central bank's decision in March to end eight years of negative interest rates and bond yield control, and underscore its resolve to move steadily towards phasing out its massive monetary stimulus. BOJ Governor Kazuo Ueda has said the bank will hike rates further if it becomes convinced that rising wages will prop up services prices, and keep inflation durably around its 2% target. While many market players expect the BOJ to raise short-term rates this year, they are divided on the exact timing. More than three-quarters of economists polled by Reuters on July 10-18 said they expect the BOJ to stand pat this month."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/piper-sandler-says-investors-should-take-trump-seriously-on-trade-3543819,"Investing.com -- Piper Sandler, in a note dated Tuesday, has reviewed its election portfolios in light of the possibility of Kamala Harris being at the top of the Democratic ticket, concluding that there is no strong argument to change them. The brokerage flags that President Biden’s agenda represents the consensus of the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and is not expected to differ significantly under Harris. The Senate remains the primary constraint for both Biden and Harris. Trump’s portfolio: Trade and macro risks Piper Sandler underscores the importance of taking Trump seriously on trade. Trade-related ideas account for about one-third of the Trump portfolio, along with macro themes around rates, the , and . These elements reflect the unusual macro risks associated with Trump, who has fewer policy tools to achieve his desired outcomes in these areas. The rest of the Trump portfolio includes long positions in energy and defense, with potential policy shifts on health care and immigration creating both winners and losers. Biden vs. Harris: Similar agendas, same constraints Biden's Build Back Better plan encompassed every major progressive priority, with successes in infrastructure, green energy, and drug price control elements. However, the ambitious social spending agenda and significant tax hikes were left undone. Harris promises to prioritize the ""care economy,"" mirroring Biden's agenda, analysts said. Harris, having served a short stint in the Senate, has not developed a deep commitment to any particular cause or issue, except for her vocal stance on abortion following the overturning of Roe v. Wade. Therefore, the analysts do not expect any departure from the Biden-Harris agenda under her presidency. The note stresses that Biden's ambitious agenda faced resistance from Senate Democrats like Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. Harris, being more progressive than Biden, will likely face similar constraints. Even in the best-case scenario for Democrats, a 50-50 Senate without Manchin or Sinema still poses challenges, with more moderate Democrats like Jon Tester or Mark Warner becoming the pivotal votes. Harris' likelihood of executive actions and court reversals Piper Sandler notes that Harris has expressed a willingness to issue executive actions exceeding her legal authority, potentially resulting in more frequent court reversals compared to Biden. Nevertheless, the investment implications remain unchanged, with the major difference being Harris' potentially greater odds of winning the election. Harris’ Portfolio: Continuation of Biden’s regulatory agenda The Harris portfolio, similar to the Biden portfolio, consists mainly of shorts due to the risks posed by a Democratic agenda to various sectors, such as internal combustion engine car companies, financial firms, drug makers, and companies threatened by the labor agenda. Piper Sandler flags that Harris would continue Biden’s regulatory agenda, which could significantly alter the automobile industry and target a wide range of financial firms. Green energy themes account for about one-third of the Harris portfolio, with solar and EV stocks positioned as longs. The portfolios are designed to perform better depending on the election outcome, with the Harris portfolio thriving under a Democratic win and the Trump portfolio under a Republican win."

The June job openings slightly exceeded market expectations, which were set at 8 million, according to the consensus. Moreover, the data for May was revised upwards by 90,000, suggesting a firmer labor market than initially reported. The layoff and discharge rate in June dipped to 0.9%. ""On net, the JOLTS data point to a labor market that has normalized, but which does not look to have turned the corner into outright weakness,"" Wells Fargo economists wrote. ""Overall, the Fed will likely read this set of data as consistent with the labor market further rebalancing, with continued weakening in hires supporting the assessment that the balance of risks is shifting in a way that favors a 25bp cut in September, but without the cracks – layoffs are very low – that would call for more aggressive or immediate easing,"" Evercore ISI economist Marco Casiraghi said in a note."

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/explainercharting-the-feds-economic-data-flow-3544042,"(Reuters) -The Federal Reserve is expected hold its benchmark overnight interest rate steady in the 5.25%-5.50% range at the conclusion of its July 30-31 policy meeting, but also signal that rate cuts may begin as soon as the U.S. central bank's meeting in September. The decision will hinge on data between now and then. Among the key statistics they are watching: JOB OPENINGS (Released July 30; next release Sept. 4): In a sign of the job market's continued resilience, the level of job openings remained above 8 million in June, while the number of open jobs available for each unemployed person fell slightly to 1.2, remaining roughly where it was in the years before the COVID-19 pandemic. Fed Chair Jerome Powell has kept a close eye on the U.S. Labor Department's Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) for information on the imbalance between labor supply and demand, and the pandemic-era jump to more than 2 to 1 in the number of open jobs for each available worker was emblematic of the time. Things have cooled substantially. Other aspects of the survey, like the quits rate, now down to 2.1, have edged back to pre-pandemic levels in what Fed officials view as an emerging balance between the supply and demand for workers. While the hiring rate has slowed, for example, the layoff rate has remained stable in a sign of companies holding on to workers. INFLATION (PCE released July 26; next release CPI Aug. 14): The personal consumption expenditures price index, used by the Fed to set its 2% inflation target, shows inflation slowly subsiding. It fell in June to a 2.5% annual rate, from 2.6% in the prior month. Core PCE prices, stripped of volatile food and energy costs, remained unchanged in June at 2.6%. Despite that reading, the data looks set to help Fed officials build more confidence that inflation is moving toward the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Traders maintained bets on a September rate reduction with about a 90% probability On a month-to-month basis, the PCE index rose 0.1% while core PCE prices edged up 0.2%. Officials have begun to pay closer attention to signs of weakening demand in the economy as a precursor to a slowed pace of price increases. The separate consumer price index released earlier this month fell in June by 0.1%, with drops in both volatile energy items and core consumer goods like vehicles, and weakness in housing costs that Fed officials have long been waiting to see. The 0.2% rise in shelter prices was the slowest since August of 2021, and overall it was the weakest CPI print since May of 2020. The data pushed the annual rise in consumer prices down to 3% from 3.3% in the prior month, with the more volatile core index, excluding food and energy, falling to 3.3% from 3.4%. EMPLOYMENT (Released July 5; next release Aug. 2): U.S. firms added a greater-than-expected 206,000 jobs in June, but revisions to the prior two months knocked 111,000 positions from the previously estimated number of payroll jobs. That pushed the three-month average total payroll growth down to 177,000, below the level typical before the pandemic and a development likely to be taken by the Fed as further evidence the job market is slowing. The unemployment rate rose slightly to 4.1%, the highest level since Nov. 2021. Fed officials have become more comfortable with the idea that continued job growth could still allow inflation to fall, especially if the supply of labor keeps growing and wage growth eases - as it did in June. The number of people in a job or looking for work grew, and fewer people dropped out of the labor force - both healthy signs that nevertheless pushed up the unemployment rate. Average hourly wages meanwhile rose 3.9% compared to a year ago, versus a 4.1% annual increase in May. The Fed generally considers wage growth in the range of 3.0%-3.5% as consistent with its 2% inflation target."

News of the presidency's spending jars with the outgoing government's message that France can ill afford its current levels of public spending, among the highest in the world in relation to the size of the economy. Macron treated the King and his wife Queen Camilla last September to blue lobster, Bresse French poultry with mushroom gratin, and a selection of French and English cheeses during the state dinner in the famed Hall of Mirrors of the 17th century Versailles Palace. That set the French state back 475,000 euros ($513,427), including 166,000 euros just for the catering, the Cour des Comptes said on Monday in a report on the finances of the French presidency. Eager to convince New Delhi to buy more French submarines and fighter jets, Macron also held a state dinner in Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's honour at the Louvre in July 2023, costing a cool 412,000 euros, the auditor said. Banquets held at the president's Elysee palace cost far less, it added, noting that a state dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping in May cost only 138,000 euros. The auditor also raised an eyebrow over the rising cost of presidential trips abroad, including the growing use of an Airbus A330 for international flights at a cost of over 23,000 euros per hour. As a result of the higher spending on state receptions and official travel, the presidency's costs rose 6.5% last year to 117.2 million euros, leaving a budget shortfall of 8.3 million euros, the audit office said.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/exclusivechina-stocks-regulator-likely-to-promote-law-enforcement-chief-to-vice-chair-sources-say-3543073,"HONG KONG/BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's securities regulator on Tuesday promoted its head of law enforcement to the role of vice chairman, underscoring Beijing's determination to tighten oversight of its $5.1 trillion stock market. Li Ming, chief of the enforcement bureau of the China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), will replace vice chairman Fang Xinghai, the CSRC said in a statement, citing a decision by China's State Council, or cabinet. The announcement confirmed an earlier report by Reuters. Fang, born in 1964, is retiring, according to sources with direct knowledge of the personnel change. President Xi Jinping is seeking to foster a capital market able to channel resources into strategic sectors such as chip-making and high-end manufacturing amid increasing economic rivalry between China, Europe and the United States. The CSRC has pledged to regulate the market with ""teeth and thorns"" under chairman Wu Qing. Prior to the promotion, Li headed the enforcement bureau, which is responsible for probing illegal securities activities, handing criminal cases to the relevant authorities and facilitating cross-border investigations. During a media conference in February, Li vowed to crack down on insider trading and market manipulation as well as stamp out securities fraud in an effort to protect investors. ""Punishment will be more and more severe, and the cost of breaking the law will only be higher and higher,"" Li said. A CSRC veteran, Li began working in its Listing Department, which oversees share sales, and in 2016 was put in charge of the National Equities Exchange, a bourse for trading over-the-counter shares, according to business media group Caixin. Li returned to the Listing Department as director-general in 2020 and was appointed to lead the enforcement bureau in 2022, the Chinese media group added. China's regulators have been scrutinising old business deals and the personal bank accounts of senior executives as they ramp up inspections of IPO hopefuls, a process that has forced firms to drop listing plans and investment banks to cut jobs and pay. The stock market scrutiny coincides with a ""common prosperity"" drive aimed at addressing social and income inequality as economic growth slows. China will ""tighten regulation to promote the sound and stable development of the capital market"", according to a resolution issued after a key Communist Party meeting held earlier this month. Li's predecessor Fang is seen as the most market-oriented senior official at the CSRC. Stanford-educated Fang has been a strong advocate of market reforms. Fang became CSRC vice chairman following a 2015 market crash and under his watch, China opened its stock and bond markets wider to foreign investors and introduced a slew of derivative products. Over the past year, however, the CSRC has restricted short-selling and cracked down on computer-driven quant funds - both seen as contributing to market volatility. ($1 = 7.2502 renminbi)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/sp-maintains-indonesias-credit-ratings-but-flags-fiscal-uncertainties-ahead-3543629,"JAKARTA (Reuters) - S&P Global Ratings affirmed on Tuesday Indonesia's ratings at BBB investment grade with a stable outlook, but flagged fiscal uncertainties from the incoming government led by Prabowo Subianto. Prabowo's team has assured the market that it will commit to the legal deficit ceiling of 3% of gross domestic product (GDP) and maintain the status quo on the debt-to-GDP ratio, after media reports speculated that the president-elect plans to revise the legal budget ceiling and may allow the debt-to-GDP ratio to rise. ""Despite these assurances, policy uncertainty is likely to remain until the next government unveils its plan in detail,"" the rating agency said in a press release. S&P expects the annual budget deficit of Southeast Asia's biggest economy in the next three years to be higher than 2022-2024 period at 2.9% of gross domestic product (GDP), due to bigger spending plans under Prabowo. ""The incoming government has indicated that it does not intend to make legal changes to allow for higher deficits. However, given its spending plans, it would likely aim for budget shortfalls close to the legal limit of 3% of GDP,"" the agency added. Prabowo's key campaign pledges include a 450 trillion rupiah ($27.62 billion) programme, equivalent to about 2% of GDP, to give free nutritious meals to more than 80 million recipients, including pregnant women, toddlers and students. Other pledges include providing more housing and increasing food production. Through those plans, the president-elect aims to reach 8% GDP growth annually, from around 5% currently. S&P, however, said Indonesia's economic growth was expected to slow slightly to 4.9% in 2026 and 2027. Indonesia's GDP growth was at 5.05% in 2023. Indonesia's revenue-to-GDP ratio in the next few years was also seen falling slightly to 14.8% of GDP from 15% in 2023, amid moderating commodity prices, such as nickel, S&P forecast. With expectation that Prabowo's government will be committed to the legal limits on budget deficits, S&P expects Indonesia's debt-to-GDP ratio in the next few years to be around 39%, well below the 60% legal ceiling. Prabowo and vice president elect, Gibran Rakabuming Raka, the eldest son of outgoing President Joko Widodo, will be sworn in this October after winning the election in February.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fomc-meeting-citi-says-risks-skew-dovish-3543540,"As the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) kicks off its two-day meeting, analysts at Citi said in a note Tuesday that the risks are skewed towards a dovish outcome. The investment bank explained that in tomorrow's press conference, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell will address a market that is currently pricing in about 65 basis points of rate cuts for this year, despite the median Fed ""dot"" indicating just a 25 basis point cut in June. Citi analysts wrote, ""Risks skew dovish as Powell is unlikely to push back against the potential for cuts at every upcoming meeting."" The bank's perspective comes amid a backdrop of softer inflation readings, partly driven by a persistent slowdown in owners' equivalent rent, which has led the market to anticipate over 2.5 rate cuts. The median ""dot"" at the June FOMC suggested only a single 25 basis point cut this year, defying expectations. However, Citi does not expect Powell to challenge the dovish market pricing. They state that if Powell wanted to signal a more hawkish stance, he could imply that the pace of rate cuts might be ""gradual,"" which the market could interpret as a move towards quarterly rate cuts. However, given the current economic indicators—slower inflation, rising unemployment, and recent equity market volatility—Citi sees little reason for Powell to oppose the market's expectations. Instead, they believe Powell is likely to suggest that the market's pricing is in line with the data, just as the Fed's policy decisions are. ""He might even go so far as to offer that neither a 50bp cut or cuts at consecutive meetings are off the table,"" Citi analysts state. The bank believes that not pushing back against the priced-in cuts could lead the market to more fully price the 75 basis points of cuts that Citi expects this year."

Inflation figures likely to be released on Thursday by the statistics agency are closely watched by the central bank, which cut rates this week for the second time in a row as previously surging inflation was tempered. The government had also cut the fiscal deficit to 4.9% of GDP between July 2023 and May 2024, the ministry said in its report, down from 5.5% last year. Pakistan struck a deal this month with the International Monetary Fund for a $7-billion-loan programme that includes tough measures such as higher tax on farm incomes and electricity prices. This prospect has aroused concern among poor and middle class Pakistanis contending with the threat of further inflation and higher taxes. Inflation has slowed in recent months after hitting more than 30% in 2023. Pakistan's consumer price index (CPI) rose 12.6% in June on the year. But pressure continues and one Islamist party has held protests in recent days and threatened sit-ins in major cities if the government does not tackle rising prices."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ethiopias-imf-deal-paves-way-for-debt-restructuring-official-says-3543214,"By Dawit Endeshaw ADDIS ABABA (Reuters) - Ethiopia's new $3.4 billion financing deal with the International Monetary Fund paves the way for completion of its long-delayed debt restructuring in the next three to six months, a senior finance ministry official said on Tuesday. The announcement of the four-year, $3.4 billion programme on Monday came hours after Ethiopia had undertaken one of the IMF's key recommendations and floated its currency, the birr. ""Debt restructuring should be finalised before the next IMF programme review,"" State Minister of Finance Eyob Tekalign told Reuters, adding that would typically be between three and six months. The IMF deal is expected to be followed by further financing of up to $7.3 billion from the World Bank and other creditors, Ethiopian officials have said. The World Bank's board was scheduled to meet later on Tuesday to approve its portion of the extra funds, Eyob said. News of the IMF deal lifted the $1 billion government bond at the centre of the restructuring plan to its highest level since October 2021 on Tuesday. A more than 2 cents jump left it trading at almost 78 cents on the dollar - or just over a 20% discount of its original face value. In the foreign exchange market, leading commercial banks quoted the Ethiopian birr at 74.74 against the dollar. That was unchanged from where it had settled after Monday's float announcement prompted it to drop 30% against the dollar. Ethiopia's development partners have welcomed the move to a market-based foreign exchange rate, but some analysts have said it could drive up inflation and the cost of living, especially for the poorest. Ethiopia also faces other challenges including the impact of climate change and the need to reconstruct its northern Tigray region, which was ravaged by a two-year civil war that ended in late 2022."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/chinas-leaders-vow-to-step-up-policy-support-for-economy-3542846,"By Kevin Yao and Ellen Zhang BEIJING (Reuters) -Chinese leaders signalled on Tuesday that the stimulus measures needed to reach this year's economic growth target will be directed at consumers, deviating from their usual playbook of pouring funds into infrastructure projects. The world's second-largest economy missed growth forecasts in the second quarter and faces deflationary pressures, with retail sales and imports significantly underperforming industrial output and exports. The Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged at the end of its July meeting to make ""countercyclical adjustments"" during the rest of 2024 to meet an economic growth goal of roughly 5% for the year. ""The meeting stressed that it is necessary to focus on boosting consumption to expand domestic demand,"" the official news agency Xinhua said. The Politburo said policies should increase residents' income ""through multiple channels"" and enhance the ""ability and willingness"" of low- and middle-income groups to spend. It called for measures to improve welfare for the elderly and children, and ""weave a dense and solid social security net"". As expected, no specific steps were announced, but the leadership pledged to ""timely launch a batch of incremental policy measures"". In referencing incomes and social welfare, it nodded to measures advocated by some economists who have long argued that China's economic model relies too heavily on investment and has produced much more debt than growth in the past 15 years. They propose Beijing transfers resources from the government sector to households to address this imbalance, which they say could lead China towards a decades-long period of low growth and periodic deflation as seen in Japan. Analysts said the latest Politburo readout contained more references to household consumption than previous ones, but this did not necessarily point to a new top-level agenda for a structural shift to rebalance the economy. The meeting's summary still gave prominent space to pursuing ""new productive forces"", a term coined by President Xi Jinping last year that envisions scientific research and technological upgrades for the world's largest industrial complex. This suggest Beijing is holding onto its supply-side priorities, analysts said. ""The meeting did call for policymaking to focus more on household welfare,"" Julian Evans-Pritchard, head of China economics at Capital Economics. ""This sounds promising on paper."" ""But the lack of any specifics means it is unclear what it will entail in practice. And overall, the communique suggests the primary focus of policy remains on economic security and nurturing new productive forces in high-end sectors."" Beijing uses the July politburo meeting to recalibrate economic policies for the rest of the year, not as a forum that discusses longer-term goals. A different Party meeting on July 15-18, which takes place roughly twice a decade, pointed to policy continuity, rather than structural shifts. The yuan, and Chinese stocks and bonds were little changed following the announcement. WEAK DEMAND After unshackling the economy from three years of COVID-19 restrictions, Chinese officials had hoped that stimulating the industrial sector would stabilise the job market and lead to higher wages and consumption. What happened instead was that greater industrial capacity led to price wars and a cost-cutting race that kept wages depressed, fuelling job uncertainty and adding to the pain among consumers caused by the property sector downturn. ""The government recognises that domestic demand is weak,"" said Zhiwei Zhang, chief economist at Pinpoint Asset Management. Authorities have already signalled in recent weeks a shift to a more supportive policy stance. China's central bank surprised markets by cutting major interest rates last week, while the state planner said some funds raised through this year's ultra-long bond issuance would be shifted towards supporting a consumer goods trade-in scheme. On the crisis-hit property sector, the Politburo reiterated existing policy goals, saying China will continue to support the delivery of unfinished projects and turn unsold apartments into affordable housing. It also reaffirmed plans for a ""proactive"" fiscal policy, and ""prudent"" monetary framework."

Fed starts policy-setting meeting The starts its July policy meeting later in the session, and after a benign June inflation report, investors after looking for the policymakers to lay the groundwork for a September rate cut. The U.S. central bank concludes its latest meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July. Investors are looking for signals about when and how many rate cuts may occur this year, and will therefore be intently following any policy guidance issued by the central bank, as well as the post-meeting press conference with Fed Chairman . Fed officials have repeatedly stated that they are looking for more evidence that inflation is steadily returning to 2% before cutting rates, but Fed Chair Jerome Powell indicated earlier this month that the central bank may not wait until inflation reaches this target before cutting rates. Futures are fully priced for a quarter-point easing in September, with a small chance of a reduction of 50 basis points, and have 66 basis points of easing priced in by Christmas. 2. Futures edge higher with corporate results in focus U.S. stock futures edged higher Tuesday as investors awaited the start of the latest Federal Reserve meeting as well as key corporate earnings. By 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the contract was 60 points, or 0.1%, higher, climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and rose by 35 points, or 0.2%. The Federal Reserve is set to start its two-day policy meeting later in the session, and investors will be looking for clues over the timing and number of rate cuts to expect this year. The main earnings release Tuesday will be from Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) after the close, but there will also be results from the likes of Merck (NYSE: ), (NYSE: ), PayPal (NASDAQ: ) and Procter & Gamble (NYSE: ) before the open, as well as Starbucks (NASDAQ: ) and AMD (NASDAQ: ) post closing bell. So far, more than 40% of the companies have reported their results with 79% posting earnings that exceeded Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG. 3. Microsoft’s Azure sales in spotlight Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) releases its quarterly results after the close Tuesday - the first of a series of numbers from the tech giants this week, including Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday and then both Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday. Investors will be looking to see if sales in Microsoft’s Azure cloud-computing business have picked up enough to justify the billions of dollars being spent on artificial intelligence infrastructure. The software behemoth is expected to report that Azure's growth stayed steady quarter-over-quarter at about 31% between April and June, according to data from Visible Alpha, helped by its tie-up with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. Microsoft's capital spending likely surged about 53% year-over-year to $13.64 billion in the period, according to 16 analysts polled by LSEG. A big step up from the $10.95 billion in expenditure it recorded in the previous quarter. Shares of Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ) fell sharply last week after the company reported a quarterly capital spending that exceeded estimates by nearly $1 billion, while the revenue boost from AI integrations remained modest, sparking a selloff in major tech companies. 4. BP (NYSE: ) lifts its dividend after Q2 results BP (LON: ) released impressive second-quarter results earlier Tuesday, resulting in the energy giant raising its dividend after beating profit forecasts. BP reported an underlying profit of $2.76 billion for the second quarter of the financial year, up from $2.59 billion in the same quarter in 2023, and slightly higher than the $2.72 billion it earned in the first three months of the year. The oil major generated substantial cash flow of $8.1 billion, enabling it to lower net debt to $22.6 billion as well as raising its dividend by 10% and announcing another share buyback, worth $1.75 billion, for the last quarter. “Our decision to increase our dividend by 10%, and extend our buyback program commitment to 4Q 2024, reflects the confidence we have in our performance and outlook for cash generation,” said CFO Kate Thomson. “We are maintaining a disciplined financial frame and remain committed to growing value and returns for BP.” At 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), BP shares rose 2.5% to £4.65, trading largely flat year-to-date. 5. Crude prices remain weak Crude prices steadied Tuesday, traded near two-month lows on continuing concerns about demand in China, the world's largest crude importer, while traders shrugged off the risk of conflict escalating in the Middle East. By 04:00 ET, the futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $75.88 a barrel, while the contract rose 0.1% to $79.09 a barrel. Traders were seen pricing out a risk premium from crude after media reports said Israeli officials were not seeking all-out war with Lebanon in their retaliation for a rocket strike that killed 12 in Israel-occupied Golan Heights. Crude prices are trading near two-month lows amid persistent concerns over slowing demand, especially in top importer China after last week’s weak growth data. That said, the Politburo, a top decision-making body of the ruling Communist Party, pledged at the end of its July meeting to pursue a ""proactive"" fiscal policy, suggesting more stimulus ahead. The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries meets later in the week to discuss output levels, although recent weakness in crude is likely to see the cartel downplay any plans for scaling back production cuts."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/bank-of-korea-board-split-on-when-to-cut-interest-rates-minutes-show-3542900,"SEOUL (Reuters) - South Korea's monetary policy board was divided over when to cut interest rates with a majority of the seven-member board concerned about lower borrowing costs leading to price increases in the housing market, July meeting minutes showed on Tuesday. The Bank of Korea said at the meeting that it was time to prepare for a pivot to interest rate cuts after leaving the benchmark interest rate steady at a 15-year high of 3.50% for the 12th straight meeting, as expected. While the decision was unanimous, the seven-member board appeared divided over when to act, as some fretted that lowering rates could lead to price increases in Seoul's already expensive housing market, while others were increasingly focused on preserving a soft landing for the economy. At least five board members said financial stability risks were of concern to the central bank due to rising home prices. ""In summary, inflation is easing towards (the bank’s) target level but we should still be on alert for upside risks, and risks related to a reduction in interest rates are bigger now due to household debt increases and the home price increases we see now,"" one of the seven board members said. Worries about inflation have recently been replaced by concerns that household debt is increasing fast and consumption is slowing rather too quickly. Any interest rate reductions should be carried out ""after factoring in the medium-term inflation level in relation to our inflation target, macroeconomic policy changes as well as FX market changes,"" another board member said. Headline inflation for June slowed to an 11-month low of 2.4%, close to its target of 2%. South Korea's economy unexpectedly shrank in the second quarter, logging the sharpest contraction since 2022 as slumping consumer spending undermined an export boom to reinforce expectations that an interest rate reduction could come in the coming months."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/new-uk-government-sets-out-spending-cuts-to-plug-hole-in-public-finances-3541725,"By David Milliken and Kylie MacLellan LONDON (Reuters) -Britain's new finance minister, Rachel Reeves, told parliament her Conservative predecessor had left public spending on track to go over budget by 21.9 billion pounds ($28 billion) this year and announced an immediate 5.5 billion pounds of cuts. Reeves pencilled in a further 8.1 billion pounds of cuts for the next financial year and promised more measures at a full budget on Oct. 30, when the newly-elected Labour government would need to make ""difficult decisions"", including on tax. Part of the cost comes from Reeves' decision to give public-sector workers pay rises costing in total 9.1 billion pounds, following recommendations from independent pay-setting bodies which she said the Conservatives had ignored for too long. Reeves said the state of the public finances was not sustainable, and posed a risk to economic stability if left unchecked. ""It therefore falls to us to take the difficult decisions now to make further in-year savings,"" she told parliament. Elected to run the world's sixth-largest economy in a landslide victory on July 4, Labour has spent much of its first three weeks in power telling voters that things are worse than expected in almost every area of public policy. Reeves inherited an economy with sluggish growth, public sector net debt at the highest since the early 1960s and a tax burden that is on track to hit a near-80 year high. The last government had also faced industrial action across the public sector, and Reeves said she would accept the recommendations on increasing pay at above-inflation rates for workers such as teachers and healthcare staff. In a statement seen by critics as an attempt to pave the way for future tax rises, Reeves accused the former Conservative government of covering up the true state of government spending and said she needed to make difficult decisions to prevent the budget deficit ballooning by 25% this year. She made cuts to a range of projects such as roadbuilding and restoring railways, said she would review a scheme to rebuild hospitals and set an ambitious target for government departments to squeeze more than 3 billion pounds from their budgets. She also said she would save around 1.5 billion pounds per year by stopping higher-income pensioners from receiving an annual payment for heating costs. FALSE HOPE Reeves commissioned the review of the public finances upon taking office, and used her announcement in parliament to attack the last government, led at different stages by Rishi Sunak, Liz Truss and Boris Johnson. ""They promised solutions that they knew could never be paid for: roads that would never be built, public transport that would never arrive, hospitals that would never treat a single patient."" The Conservatives dismissed her accusations as a pretext for Labour to raise taxes. ""Today's exercise is not economic, it's political. She wants to blame the last Conservative government for tax rises and project cancellations she has been planning all along,"" said Jeremy Hunt, who was finance minister in the Conservative government. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS), said some of the funding pressures did appear to be greater than expected. ""Some of the specifics are indeed shocking, and raise some difficult questions for the last government,"" he said. Britain's non-partisan Office for Budget Responsibility, which scrutinises governments' tax and spend plans, said it would review how Hunt's budget in March was prepared, saying it was a serious issue. Reeves stressed that she intends to stick to her party's election campaign commitments not to raise the rates of income tax, value-added tax and other main taxes. Any other tax changes would come in October's formal budget statement, which Reeves said would contain a new set of non-negotiable fiscal rules. ($1 = 0.7795 pounds)"

The review is the third under Egypt's latest 46-month IMF loan programme, which was approved in 2022 and expanded to $8 billion this year following an economic crisis marked by high inflation and severe foreign currency shortages. Egypt says it has shifted to a flexible exchange rate regime, a policy the IMF said on Monday remains ""a cornerstone of the authorities' program."" ""Inflationary pressures are gradually abating, foreign exchange shortages have been eliminated, and fiscal targets (including related to spending by large infrastructure projects) were met,"" an IMF statement said. ""While there has been progress on some critical structural reforms, greater efforts are needed to implement the State Ownership Policy (SOP),"" it added. The Fund called on Egypt to accelerate a programme of divestment of state-owned enterprises and carry out reforms to prevent them from using unfair competitive practices. It also said Egypt, where falling production has contributed to daily power cuts since last year, needed to contain fiscal risks from the energy sector. ""Restoring energy prices to their cost recovery levels, including retail fuel prices by December 2025, is essential to supporting the smooth provision of energy to the population and reducing imbalances in the sector,"" the IMF quoted its Deputy Managing Director Antoinette M. Sayeh as saying. Egypt raised domestic fuel prices by up to 15% ahead of the IMF review, which had been postponed from July 10."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/exclusivespacex-in-talks-to-land-and-recover-starship-rocket-off-australias-coast-3542067,"By Joey Roulette WASHINGTON (Reuters) - SpaceX is in talks with U.S. and Australian officials to land and recover one of its Starship rockets off Australia's coast, a possible first step toward a bigger presence for Elon Musk's company in the region as the two countries bolster security ties, according to three people familiar with the plans. Since a Starship rocket made a controlled splashdown for the first time in June in the Indian Ocean, SpaceX has been eager to expand its testing campaign. Successful landings and recovery of the boosters afterward are important elements of the speedy development of the giant and reusable rocket designed to launch satellites to orbit and land astronauts on the moon. The plan would be to launch Starship from a SpaceX facility in Texas, land it in the sea off Australia's coast and recover it on Australian territory. Getting permission to do so would require loosening U.S. export controls on sophisticated space technologies bound for Australia, according to the sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity. President Joe Biden's administration already has sought to ease similar restrictions within the AUKUS security alliance, a grouping of the United States, Australia and Britain aimed at countering China. SpaceX, the U.S. Space Force and the Australian Space Agency did not immediately reply to requests for comment. Towing Starship, after it has landed in the ocean or on a barge, to a nearby port on Australia's western or northern coasts would be ideal, though more specific plans and locations are still being discussed, the sources said. The conversations underscore the U.S. determination to help Australia build up its military as a deterrent to an increasingly assertive China in the region. The proposed SpaceX arrangement would put more trust in a close American ally that for years has sought to expand its space defense program, strengthen civil and military space ties with the United States and stimulate its own space industrial base. Discussions in recent weeks between SpaceX executives and U.S. and Australian officials have focused on regulatory hurdles in bringing a recovered Starship booster ashore in a foreign country, the sources said. Because the talks are ongoing, the timing of any Starship landing off Australia remained unclear. The sources said the proposed test-landings likely would be the first phase of a larger future Australian presence for SpaceX that could include launching from a facility on the continent or landing a Starship booster on the ground instead of the ocean, though discussions on those possibilities are in the early stages. In developing its partially reusable Falcon 9 about a decade ago, SpaceX also made ocean-based test landings before attempting touchdowns on land and atop barges at sea. Falcon 9 is now SpaceX's workhorse rocket, and its first-stage booster has made hundreds of routine landings from space. A TOWERING ROCKET Starship is a 400-foot (120-meter) tall two-stage rocket designed to be fully reusable. It represents SpaceX's next-generation rocket system, meant to loft large batches of satellites into space, land NASA astronauts on the lunar surface and potentially ferry military cargo around the world in roughly 90 minutes. Starship's June test flight was its most successful to date. Starship was launched from Texas toward space on a suborbital trajectory that sent it freefalling at hypersonic speeds back through Earth's atmosphere before reigniting its engines for a soft splashdown in the Indian Ocean, about 90 minutes after launch. Its SuperHeavy booster landed in the Gulf of Mexico. Previous test flights had ended with Starship disintegrating before a safe landing could be achieved. The June flight has led SpaceX to pursue a new phase of more complicated landing tests, according to multiple people familiar with the campaign. The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory's conceptual ""Rocket Cargo"" program envisions using suborbital rockets to swiftly deliver military cargo around the world in 90 minutes, called point-to-point delivery. Some at the Pentagon viewed the June Starship test launch as a crucial demonstration of this program, according to U.S. defense officials. A Starship launch from Texas and landing off Australia could further demonstrate point-to-point delivery. While still in an early phase, the delivery time for rocket-based cargo around the planet - taking advantage of orbital velocity of 17,000 miles per hour (27,350 kph) and a hypersonic reentry through Earth's atmosphere - would be a fraction of the roughly 12 to 24 hours typically needed for traditional aircraft. SpaceX since 2021 has been studying how to use to Starship for those deliveries under a $102 million Pentagon contract. The program will graduate to a more serious prototype effort with the U.S. Space Force next year, according to 2025 budget documents."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/boj-to-debate-rate-hike-timing-as-fed-opens-door-to-cuts-3542772,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) -The Bank of Japan will detail plans to taper its huge bond buying and debate the timing of a next interest rate hike on Wednesday, signalling its resolve to steadily unwind a decade of massive monetary stimulus. The decision comes as the U.S. Federal Reserve looks to cut interest rates, possibly as early as September, reversing an aggressive rate-hike cycle that drove up the dollar and caused a painful yen sell-off for Japan. Expectations of narrowing U.S.-Japan interest rate differentials have pulled the yen off 38-year lows, taking some pressure off the BOJ to slow the currency's drop by combining a rate hike with an ambitious bond-tapering plan. But the yen's rebound also gives the central bank a chance to hike rates without giving markets the impression it is directly targeting yen moves through monetary policy, analysts say. ""The BOJ can move either way. If it wants to hike rates now, it can say consumption will rebound due to higher wages,"" said Yoshiki Shinke, senior executive economist at Dai-ichi Life Research Institute. ""If it wants to play it safe, it can await more data. Either way, the consumption outlook holds the key."" While the BOJ insists it does not use monetary policy to affect currency moves, rising concern over a weak yen has prompted some calls from government and business leaders for the central bank to speed up its shift away from near-zero rates. At the two-day meeting ending on Wednesday, the BOJ will decide on a quantitative tightening (QT) plan that will likely halve monthly bond buying in 1-1/2 to two years' time - a pace roughly in line with dominant market forecasts. The board will also debate whether to raise short-term rates from 0-0.1%, which could be a close call as policymakers remain split on how long they should scrutinise data before pulling the trigger. More than three-quarters of economists polled by Reuters on July 10-18 expect the BOJ to stand pat. Money markets are pricing in a 64% chance of a 10 bps hike. The BOJ's decision will come hours before that of the Fed, which is likely to hold rates steady before cutting rates as soon as September. RECOVERY DOUBTS Japan's economy is at an inflection point with core inflation holding above the BOJ's 2% target for well over two years and workers getting their biggest base pay hikes in three decades. But rising living costs have hurt consumption, pushing the economy into contraction in the first quarter and casting doubt on whether households can swallow further price increases. Still, with inflation keeping real borrowing costs low, the BOJ will likely drop signs that it is on course for a steady rate hike path through 2026 to remove what it sees as excessive monetary support. Such clues, or guidance on the future rate hike path, will likely come from Governor Kazuo Ueda's post-meeting briefing or a quarterly outlook report due after the meeting. In the report, the BOJ will likely roughly maintain its projection made in April that inflation will stay around its 2% target in coming years, sources have told Reuters. Ueda has said the central bank will hike rates further if it becomes convinced that rising wages will prop up services inflation, and keep inflation durably around its 2% target. Such projections are not without pitfalls. The yen has surged from around 162 per dollar in mid-July to roughly 153 per dollar, its biggest two-week gain of the year. If yen rises continue, that could ease inflationary pressure from import costs in coming months. There is also uncertainty on whether one-off tax cuts and rising wages will change households' frugal spending, as the BOJ projects. Household spending unexpectedly fell in May and service sector sentiment worsened to levels unseen in nearly two years. ""On the surface, inflation may appear to be overshooting. But the underlying factors driving price moves aren't very strong,"" said former BOJ board member Takahide Kiuchi, who is currently an economist at Nomura Research Institute. ""I don't see evidence that backs up the BOJ's view that demand-driven inflation is accelerating steadily towards 2%."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/boj-preview-rate-hike-uncertain-but-qe-exit-in-sight-3542778,"Investing.com-- The Bank of Japan is set to conclude a , with analysts split over whether the central bank will hike interest rates, especially amid recent volatility in the yen. But the BOJ is widely expected to flag an end to its quantitative easing programs, after it said in its June meeting that it will elaborate on its plans to taper down its asset purchases during the July meeting. The BOJ had kept its benchmark short-term rate unchanged at 0.1% in June, after hiking the rate for the first time in 17 years in March. Wednesday’s decision comes amid increased volatility in the , after the currency firmed sharply against the dollar over the past two weeks. Suspected intervention, an unwinding carry trade and expectations of U.S. interest rate cuts drove the yen to its strongest level in over two months. The case for a BOJ hike Analyst forecasts for a hike were either 10 basis points or 15 basis points. Speculation over a BOJ hike rose following some signs of pick-up in Japanese inflation over the past month, on higher wages. This trend is mostly in line with the BOJ’s stance that inflation will sustainably reach its 2% annual target, giving the central bank more headroom to increase rates. “At a minimum, upside risks to inflation have intensified. If the BoJ does raise its inflation track or say that upside inflation risks are intensifying, then this should be a rationale to tighten policy according to Ueda’s rhetoric. Thus, we expect the BoJ to raise rates by 15bp, taking the policy range to 15bp-25bp,” ANZ analysts wrote in a note. Japanese wages were seen increasing this year after several major labor unions negotiated bumper wage increases for the year. This is also expected to underpin consumption and inflation in the coming months. The case for a BOJ hold But even with inflation showing some signs of pick-up, concerns over a broader slowdown in the Japanese economy could keep the BOJ from raising rates. The central bank has repeatedly warned that monetary conditions will remain relatively loose to foster economic growth- a notion that could keep the bank from raising rates soon. Media reports also suggested that Governor Kazuo Ueda was reluctant to hike rates due to concerns over sluggish consumption. Recent data showed the Japanese economy shrank much more than expected in the first quarter, weighed especially by weak consumption. “The BOJ is convinced that the virtuous cycle between wages and consumption is strengthening. However, real wage growth has remained in negative territory, which could lead the BOJ to keep policy rates on hold,” ING analysts said, although they still expect the central bank to narrowly settle on a 15 bps hike. Nikkei to fall, yen likely to firm Any signs of tightening monetary policy are likely to batter Japanese stocks and favor the yen. An end to the BOJ’s asset purchase programs already heralds lesser support for local equities, while a stronger yen presents earnings pressure on export-oriented stocks, which make up a bulk of Japanese stock valuations. The had tumbled over the past week, hit in part by a technology rout and as investors positioned for potentially hawkish signals from the BOJ. The yen on the other hand marked a strong rally over the past two weeks, and may see more strength if the BOJ signals hawkishness. BoFA analysts expect USDJPY to potentially drop to 145 yen on a hawkish BOJ."
https://www.investing.com/news/economic-indicators/chinas-new-productive-forces-need-government-market-efforts-vice-premier-3542777,"BEIJING (Reuters) - China's Vice Premier He Lifeng stressed the need for a well-coordinated government and efficient market to develop the country's ""new productive forces"", state media said on Tuesday. President Xi Jinping introduced the term last year, focusing on scientific research and technological advancements within China's vast industrial sector. The recent key Communist Party meeting reaffirmed this approach. ""Developing new productive forces is a long-term task and a systematic project. We need both historical patience and a sense of urgency that time and tide wait for no man,"" he wrote in an article published by the People's Daily on Tuesday. He emphasised the government's role in creating layout and rules, and providing fiscal and tax support to prevent overcapacity and resource wastage due to repeated construction. He also highlighted the importance of the market mechanism in fostering technological and industrial innovation. ""It is necessary to give full play to the decisive role of the market in resource allocation, strengthen the dominant position of enterprises in scientific and technological innovation, and make all types of enterprises become the main force in the development of new productive forces."" China's private sector has been under pressure. Private sector investment grew by a mere 0.1% in the first half of 2024 from a year earlier compared with a 6.8% gain in state-sector investment for the same period. Even if China's gross domestic product per capita ranked forefront among middle-income countries in 2023, He said ""we should see that the problem of unbalanced and inadequate development is still prominent and, the scientific and technological innovation capability is not strong yet."" ""The gap in income distribution is still large, resource and environmental constraints are tightening, and the limitations of traditional productivity and growth models have become increasingly prominent."" He added developing ""new productive forces"" is a response to the call of the times to win the initiative in development, as the U.S. and other western countries' suppress China and try to decouple and de-link from it. ""Currently, in the face of fierce competition from major countries, China's future industrial development faces a situation: if we stop moving forward, we fall back; if we move forward slowly, we fall back too."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/colombia-pitches-bulkedup-130-billion-government-budget-for-next-year-3542688,"By Nelson Bocanegra BOGOTA (Reuters) -Colombia's government proposed on Monday a 523 trillion peso ($130 billion) 2025 budget to lawmakers for their consideration, the finance ministry said in a statement, as mounting fiscal challenges put pressure on President Gustavo Petro's agenda. The government budget proposal compares to this year's 483-trillion-peso budget, which in June was slashed by 20 trillion pesos, the ministry said. WHY IT'S IMPORTANT Petro is about to enter the second half of his presidential term, but without the backing of a solid majority in Congress to approve his economic and social priorities. Congress must approve the budget bill by Oct. 20 and could make significant changes to it. Diego Guevara, Colombia's vice-minister for finance, said the government will seek some 12 trillion pesos via a new financing law set to go through Congress, in order to cover the funds required for the budget plan. KEY QUOTES ""This is a budget that bets on economic reactivation,"" budget director Jairo Bautista told a press conference. ""It manages to target fundamental spending objectives in key economic sectors such as health, education and infrastructure."" BY THE NUMBERS The bill sets out operating expenses of about 327.9 trillion pesos, debt service funds of 112.6 trillion and investments of 82.4 trillion. The finance ministry said the budget was consistent with next year's targets of economic growth of 3% and a fiscal deficit of 5.1% of gross domestic product (GDP), which the government set out in a mid-term framework last month. CONTEXT The ministry also plans to propose legislation to bring forward certain fiscal changes that were set to take effect as of 2026. CARF, an autonomous fiscal committee, said earlier this month that Colombia's government may need further adjustments to its accounts to comply with fiscal rules this year and next and stabilize its debt in the face of risks to tax collection goals.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/fed-likely-to-hold-rates-steady-one-last-time-as-inflation-fight-finale-unfolds-3540844,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at a two-day policy meeting this week but open the door to interest rate cuts as soon as September by acknowledging inflation has edged nearer to the U.S. central bank's 2% target. Policymakers in advance of the July 30-31 meeting were reluctant to commit to the timing of a first rate cut, but audibly cheered recent data showing price pressures were easing broadly, with headline inflation moving closer to the Fed's target and evidence from job, housing and other markets suggesting that trend would continue. Data on Friday showed the Fed's preferred personal consumption expenditures price index, which was accelerating by as much as 7.1% on a year-over-year basis in 2022, rose by 2.5% in June after a 2.6% gain in May. Since March, in fact, the annualized month-to-month changes in the PCE price index show it rising at just 1.5% - half a percentage point below the Fed's target. A companion measure stripping out volatile food and energy prices is trending at 2.3% over that same window - within sight of the 2% goal. Combined with a broader sense that price pressures are easing, that data may be enough for Fed officials to change their description of inflation as ""elevated"" in next week's policy statement, and note rising confidence that the pace of price increases will return to 2%. Policymakers have said they should start cutting interest rates before inflation fully returns to their target, and if upcoming data stays in line with recent months they may be running out of time. The Fed ""is only 50 basis points from the target ... so it seems that is not very far,"" said Jim Bullard, the former president of the St. Louis Fed and now dean of Purdue University's Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. School of Business. ""Is it still elevated? Sure. But it is not as elevated as it was,"" Bullard said. A slight change in the statement, perhaps describing it as ""moderately elevated,"" would ""send a major signal to markets that you are taking on board all that disinflation that has occurred over the last year and you think it is for real and you don't think it is going to turn around."" The Fed lifted its benchmark interest rate to slow the economy after inflation surged, and has held it steady in the current 5.25%-to-5.50% range since last July, making the current run of tight monetary policy among the longest in recent decades. Despite warnings last year that such strict financial conditions could trigger a recession, the Fed at least for now appears to have hit a sweet spot. Inflation has fallen, and while the unemployment rate has risen gradually it remains, at 4.1%, around what many Fed officials see as representing full employment. Some data, including disappointing recent home sales and rising loan delinquencies, may point to weakness. But the most recent report on overall economic output was surprisingly strong, with growth at a 2.8% annualized rate in the second quarter. The Fed regards the economy's underlying potential growth, consistent with stable inflation, at about 1.8%. ""They have had encouraging inflation data ... Clearly the economy is slowing. The balance of risks is different than it was four months ago. Full stop,"" said Nathan Sheets, global chief economist at Citi. ""It feels like they want to be a little more certain, so signal in July and cut in September."" POLITICAL VIBES The U.S. central bank will release its latest policy statement at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT) on Wednesday, and Fed Chair Jerome Powell will hold a press conference half an hour later. Acknowledging that rate reductions are imminent would put the Fed in line with investors who consider it a near certainty that it will deliver at least a quarter-percentage-point cut at the Sept. 17-18 meeting, the first step in reversing the most rapid series of rate increases in four decades. It would also put the Fed in the spotlight of a tumultuous U.S. presidential race. Inflation may be less of a centerpiece issue in an election that has included an assassination attempt against former President Donald Trump, the Republican nominee, and the withdrawal from the race of President Joe Biden, who was replaced by Vice President Kamala Harris as the Democrats' presidential nominee. But Republican lawmakers earlier this month told Powell in a hearing that a rate cut in September could seem like an effort to tilt the playing field against Trump, who installed him as Fed chief early in 2018 only to turn deeply critical of his leadership of the central bank. Among Fed officials, however, sentiment is broadly shared that inflation is easing, including among some of the central bank's more hawkish voices. Fed Governor Christopher Waller, another Trump appointee, in particular said that inflation data was close to the point where rate cuts would be warranted and the labor market close to the point where the unemployment rate might be at risk of rising fast. Prices and inflation, meanwhile, may still figure into the election. In its latest election modeling, Oxford Economics said that how swing voters interpret coming economic data could push them towards Trump and the Republicans if they still ""fixate on the level of prices and how much they have risen,"" or towards Harris and the Democrats if they ""focus on recent trends in inflation and the low level of unemployment."" Fed rate cuts could be felt quickly on that front, potentially translating into lower borrowing costs for home mortgages, credits cards, and an array of household and business financial products."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/ethiopia-clinches-deal-with-the-imf-for-34-billion-in-financing-imf-says-3542228,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Ethiopia has secured an agreement with the International Monetary Fund for a new financing program worth $3.4 billion, the IMF said on Monday. Ethiopia's central bank floated the country's birr currency on Monday, a key step to secure IMF support, and to make progress on a long-delayed debt restructuring. The Horn-of-Africa nation, which is struggling with high inflation and chronic foreign currency shortages, became the third economy on the continent in as many years to default on its debt at the end of last year. It has been in talks with the IMF since last year to establish a new lending program, after the last fund-supported program agreed in 2019 was abandoned due to conflict in the northern region of Tigray that ended with a November 2022 peace deal. Reuters previously reported Ethiopia was seeking to secure about $3.5 billion in a deal with the IMF. The IMF said the agreement will enable an immediate disbursement of about $1 billion. Africa's second-most populous country requested a debt restructuring under the Group of 20's Common Framework process in early 2021, but progress was slowed by the civil war in Tigray that lasted two years. The government in Addis Ababa has unveiled some economic reforms, which analysts say are linked to the negotiations for a new IMF program, including the adoption of an interest rate-based monetary policy earlier this month."

The Treasury Department lowered its net borrowing estimate for the July through September quarter to $740 billion, down from the $847 billion amount it had forecast in late April, driven by higher cash balance. The higher cash balance was driven by a slower pace of bond selling, or quantitative tightening that was announced in June, reducing the Treasury's financing needs by $35B a month. Ahead of the announcement, Jefferies had expected ""a modest downward revision to Q3 borrowing to a total of $750B.""

https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/uk-public-sector-workers-get-aboveinflation-pay-rises-worth-9-billion-pounds-3541913,"LONDON (Reuters) -British public sector workers such as teachers and doctors are set to receive inflation-busting pay rises worth 9.4 billion pounds ($12.1 billion) that will pressure the public purse but help avoid disruptive industrial action, the government said on Monday. The new Labour government said it would make cuts to public spending in other areas, finance minister Rachel Reeves said as she blamed the previous Conservative administration for covering up the scale of the black hole in the public finances. ""I have today set out our decision to meet the recommendation of the pay review bodies, because the previous government failed to prepare for these recommendations in their departmental budgets,"" Reeves told parliament as she announced the pay rises. ""They come at an additional cost of 9 billion pounds this year,"" she said. But the pay rises, based on the advice of independent pay review bodies, also seek to balance the pressure on public finances with the need to curb industrial unrest and address staff retention. Governments are not bound by the review bodies' recommendations although they have usually accepted them. Strikes by doctors, nurses, teachers and civil servants over pay in the last two years have heaped pressure on vital public services including the state-funded NHS. The Trades Union Congress, Britain's umbrella union body, warned in the run-up to this month's election of public sector strikes if the new government did not sufficiently raise workers' pay. Prime Minister Keir Starmer's Labour Party won a landslide victory in the July 4 vote. About 1.3 million NHS workers - including nurses and paramedics - and around 500,000 teachers will receive a pay rise of 5.5%. Junior doctors, who have staged a series of strikes over pay since early last year, will receive an average 22.3% pay rise over two years. Armed forces staff will receive 6%. ($1 = 0.7785 pounds)"
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/discount-window-reform-bill-introduced-as-fed-works-on-its-own-overhaul-3541691,"By Michael S. Derby (Reuters) - Federal Reserve efforts to overhaul a key emergency lending facility historically viewed with anxiety by banks are now being joined by potential congressional action. On Friday, Democratic Senator Mark Warner of Virginia introduced legislation to overhaul the Fed's discount window, a long-running tool that provides fast, collateralized loans to deposit-taking banks. The Fed is already working to make sure banks are ready and willing to use the discount window, either in times of stress or if they simply face an unexpected liquidity shortfall. Banks have long shunned it, fearing that using it will send a signal of distress to their peers. That long-standing stigma stood out in March 2023 when several banks ran into trouble and spurred fears about the overall state of the banking system. While discount window usage briefly surged, the Fed was concerned enough to launch a temporary lending facility with very generous terms that proved popular. Since then Fed officials have been seeking to make sure banks are prepared to use the discount window and have signaled some confidence their efforts are working. Warner's bill could bolster that. ""The failures of Silicon Valley Bank and (OTC: ) last year highlighted the urgent need to reform the Federal Reserve's discount window for the 21st century economy, where bank runs can occur over hours, rather than days,"" Warner said in a statement. He said the bill will help surmount stigma issues and ensure the discount window can ""meet the challenges of the digital age."" The bill would mandate all but the smallest banks test their discount window access and would require regulators to reflect banks' ability to use the facility when evaluating their liquidity. The bill would compel the Fed to report on the stigma issue to Congress, addressing what further steps need to be taken to reduce banks' worries. The discount window ""has deficiencies that have led to severe stigma, increasing the risk of banking panics and deposit runs,"" former New York Fed President William Dudley said in Warner's statement announcing the bill. ""This bill will provide a good basis for regulators to implement operational improvements and reduce frictions that hinder the effectiveness of ( ) discount window."" Steven Kelly, associate director of research at the Yale Program on Financial Stability, said the bill ""gives the Fed clearer direction from its congressional overseers on how to pursue these liquidity reforms."" ""This bill does not read as something designed to pick a fight with the Fed,"" Kelly said, as ""it seems mostly simpatico with what they've already signaled."" A recent New York Fed paper said eliminating stigma may prove impossible and the central bank may have to rely on ad-hoc responses to liquidity problems. Earlier this month Fed Chair Jerome Powell called discount window reform ""a big, big project."" ""We know that the infrastructure is a little tired,"" Powell said, but while work moves forward the Fed has ""not made a lot of progress."" Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan was more upbeat. Earlier this month she said more than 5,000 deposit-taking banks had done the paperwork needed to access the discount window, with banks having pledged $3 trillion in collateral for potential loans, up from $1 trillion last year. Meanwhile, in a May interview, New York Fed President John Williams said the facility does the job when trouble strikes, its long-standing issues notwithstanding. When there's a ""general market issue"" it's clear banks will use it, and that's a positive for broader market stability, he said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/uk-markets-watchdog-says-to-review-rules-to-cut-costs-boost-growth-3541673,"By Huw Jones LONDON (Reuters) - Britain's financial watchdog on Monday launched two reviews of retail conduct and insurance rules to cut costs and improve competitiveness, now that a strict new duty to put consumers first has had time to bed down. Under the rule introduced a year ago, financial firms must show the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) they put customers' interests first when designing and selling products - a measure aimed at drawing a line under past mis-selling scandals. The FCA said on Monday it was asking the industry to identify retail conduct rules that could be scrapped or simplified if they overlap with the new duty, giving them until the end of October to do so. ""We now want to seize the opportunity of the Duty and the move to a clear outcomes-based approach to streamline our rulebook, lowering costs for businesses and supporting the competitiveness and growth of the economy,"" FCA Chief Executive Nikhil Rathi said in a statement. A second review will consider simplifying customer protection rules for commercial insurance sold to businesses, a market worth 15.5 billion pounds ($19.88 billion) in Britain. Last year, the FCA was given a new, secondary objective of supporting the international competitiveness of Britain's financial sector, piling pressure on the watchdog to show how it is cutting red tape, including easing company listings rules on Monday. The watchdog published its first annual report on applying the objective, saying it accelerated the authorisation of firms, with 98% of applications assessed within legal deadlines, up from 78.9% in the first quarter of the financial year starting April 2022. The objective was introduced after Britain was cut off from the European Union due to Brexit, and as UK companies still choose to list in New York. In the City of London, home to Britain's main financial district, there has been scepticism over whether regulators have the necessary ""mindset"" to aid competitiveness and growth under the new objective, but Rathi said on Monday the FCA had been facilitating competitiveness ""long before"" it was mandated.

The budget will set out new tax and spending plans and a fresh set of fiscal and economic forecasts from the independent Office for Budget Responsibility, as well as revised bond issuance targets from the UK Debt Management Office. Britain's last budget was on March 6 under Conservative finance minister Jeremy Hunt. Reeves says the Conservatives had handed over the worst economic legacy since World War Two and on Monday detailed areas where she said they had overspent or failed to budget appropriately. British public sector net debt in June totalled 99.5% of annual economic output, the highest since the early 1960s, or 91.6% on the government's preferred measure which excludes debt related to Bank of England operations. This debt level leaves Britain mid-table in the Group of Seven large, advanced economies. The budget deficit in the 2023/24 financial year amounted to 4.5% of GDP, the lowest since the start of the pandemic and well below the 10.3% in Labour's last full fiscal year in government in 2009/10 during the global financial crisis. Taxation as a share of GDP is the highest since the late 1940s."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/fomc-to-leave-rates-unchanged-this-week-may-lay-groundwork-for-september-cut-3541215,"Federal Reserve officials are widely expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday but are anticipated to signal that the first 25 basis point (bps) rate cut could come at the next meeting in September. However, Evercore ISI strategists believe the Fed will stop short of explicitly pre-signaling a rate reduction at that September meeting. “The Fed leadership is proceeding methodically to build the case for a cut and internal consensus as to the gameplan for subsequent moves,” they wrote. “We believe Powell will wait until Jackson Hole end August – by which time the Fed will have another month’s data – to deliver the explicit September cut signal,” strategists added. The debate leading up to the July meeting revolves around how forward-leaning the FOMC is willing to be and how firmly it supports Powell’s view that the balance of risks to inflation and employment is shifting in favor of cutting rates soon to ensure a soft landing. According to Evercore, key elements to watch for in the statement include an upgrade in the language on inflation progress, an assessment that labor data has moderated, increased emphasis on the balance of risks. Moreover, strategists said there could also be a potential change to the third paragraph of FOMC’s recent statement, which indicates that the Committee does not expect to cut rates until it has greater confidence that inflation is moving sustainably towards 2%. ""We could see anything from no change to that third paragraph language – a bit hawkish though we would not overdo it – to a surprisingly explicit signal the Committee is preparing to cut at the next meeting – clearly dovish."" Economists at Citi voiced similar remarks, stating that the most likely approach for Fed officials is to use the July meeting to build consensus and signal an upcoming rate cut. Provided there is no significant upside surprise in inflation, officials are expected to deliver the nearly fully-priced 25 basis point rate cut in September. A quicker increase in the unemployment rate, for instance, reaching 4.3% or higher by August, could lead the Fed to signal continued cuts in November or even consider a 50 basis point rate cut, economists noted. ""A deepening and broadening of the sell-off in equity markets could also become a significant enough tightening of financial conditions to provoke a more dovish policy path,"" they said in a note. “Given upside risks to unemployment we see asymmetric risk to a more dovish policy path. In our base case the Fed cuts rates 25bp in September and then at each subsequent policy meeting until reaching a terminal rate of 3.25-3.50%.” Separately, while also expecting the first 25 basis point rate cut in September, Macquarie economists forecast a total of 75 basis points in cuts, bringing the Fed funds rate to 4.5-4.75% by early 2025. An unexpected labor market weakening could prompt a more aggressive easing cycle than anticipated, they pointed out."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/global-economys-growing-resilience-at-odds-with-rate-cut-expectations-reuters-poll-3541133,"By Hari Kishan BENGALURU (Reuters) - Optimism about global growth prospects this year and next is building among hundreds of economists polled by Reuters, with risks still tilted toward higher inflation even as they cling on to their forecasts for interest rate cuts. While most major central banks were successful last year in taming sky-rocketing inflation rates with rapid rate hikes, a resilient global economy with strong employment and wage growth has kept alive risks of price pressures surging again. In all, a 56% majority of economists - 114 of 202 who responded to a question about inflation in the global poll covering nearly 50 top economies taken July 8-25 - said it was more likely to be higher than they forecast for the remainder of the year than lower. So too with rates. The global economy was forecast to grow 3.1% this year and next, an upgrade from the 2.9% and 3.0% forecast in an April poll and roughly in line with the International Monetary Fund's latest prediction. But even with that upgrade, many central banks are still expected to cut rates at least twice by year-end. ""I think the big story here is that growth globally has managed to keep grinding ahead ... the global economy has managed to hang in there in the face of a lot of stresses and strains and of course the major tightening cycle of the past two years,"" Douglas Porter, chief economist at BMO Capital Markets, said. ""It's still growing a little faster than 3% despite a wide variety of challenges ... Our call is for growth to hang in there in the neighborhood of 3% through the second half."" That optimism stands in contrast to worries earlier this year whether the U.S. economy would be able to absorb such an aggressive season of monetary tightening without a downturn, even though concerns about the No. 2 economy, China, remain. Growth rates for 24 of the 48 top economies surveyed were upgraded from three months ago, with 13 of those from developed economies, where there had been concerns about flagging demand, and the remaining 11 in emerging ones. Eighteen economies saw a downgrade and six were left unchanged. Still, among major central banks, economists expect the Federal Reserve and the Bank of England to cut rates twice this year, and the European Central Bank three, the survey showed. Forecasters have held to a more consistent view than financial traders and investors. Aggressive market pricing for rate cuts at the start of the year retreated from six Fed cuts, down to one or two recently, and is now back to three. With growth holding up for now, inflation still will mostly dictate how low interest rates can go and when. Even now a good majority of central banks - 19 of 27 with an inflation target - were not expected to meet it by end-2024. ""Risks are building ... in global core goods prices, where shipping costs are nearing 2021/22 highs,"" James Rossiter, head of global macro strategy at TD Securities, said. ""We don't expect as big a boost to inflation this time around ... But the threat of higher core goods inflation could reduce the offset to sticky services inflation and slow rate cuts."" Asked which component of core inflation will be the most sticky for the remainder of 2024, a majority - 56 of 104 who responded to that question - said services, followed by 30 choosing shelter and rents. The remaining 18 cited others. A 60% majority, 131 of 220, said interest rates by the end of the year were more likely to be higher than they currently forecast instead of lower.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/terminal-federal-funds-rate-to-hit-325350-in-2025-citi-3541105,"Citi analysts anticipate significant changes in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy, projecting that the terminal federal funds rate will decline to 3.25-3.50% by 2025. In their recent note, the bank's analysts detailed expectations for the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) to signal the commencement of rate cuts, starting with a 25 basis point reduction in September. ""Fed officials are widely expected to hold rates steady on Wednesday at 2 PM but should send a clear signal that the first 25bp rate cut will be delivered at the next meeting in September,"" Citi analysts stated. They explain that this potential rate cut is made possible by slowing inflation, which grants the Fed flexibility to reduce rates without immediate inflationary pressures. The Citi note highlights that the rising unemployment rate could further compel the Fed to act swiftly in cutting rates. ""The rising unemployment rate will likely increase the sense of urgency to cut in the coming months,"" the analysts noted. They predict a 75 basis point reduction this year, followed by continuous 25 basis point cuts at each subsequent meeting until the terminal rate target of 3.25-3.50% is reached in 2025. In their analysis, Citi clarifies that recent data trends support the Fed's inclination towards rate cuts. Core PCE inflation figures have shown a deceleration, with the annualized rate falling to 2.9% in Q2. This slowdown, coupled with reduced shelter inflation, ""should finally give Fed officials confidence to begin guiding toward rate cuts."" The path to achieving the terminal rate involves navigating various economic signals and policy debates among Fed officials. However, as Citi analysts conclude, ""The path of least resistance is for Fed officials to use the July meeting to build consensus and signal an upcoming cut."" In summary, Citi's forecast of a terminal federal funds rate of 3.25-3.50% by 2025 hinges on the Fed's strategic response to inflation and unemployment trends, with initial rate cuts expected as soon as September."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/economic-uncertainties-still-prevent-rate-cut-in-brazil-official-says-3540847,"By Marcela Ayres and Bernardo Caram RIO DE JANEIRO (Reuters) - The global economic uncertainties that led Brazil's central bank to halt its monetary easing cycle have persisted, preventing an interest rate cut this week, a Finance Ministry official told Reuters. In a Friday interview on the sidelines of the G20 finance leaders' meetings in Rio de Janeiro, Guilherme Mello said Brazil's interest rates are far above the level considered neutral for the economy. Nonetheless, he noted that the environment has not significantly improved since June, when the central bank held borrowing costs at 10.5% following seven consecutive rate cuts. Mello's comments echo the central bank's unanimous call for increased caution when it decided to pause the easing cycle due to an ""uncertain global and domestic scenario,"" amid the prospect of prolonged high interest rates in the U.S. and a stronger-than-expected economy in Brazil, where inflation expectations have risen. They contrast with leftist President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who repeatedly criticized the level of interest rates and the monetary policy decisions of the central bank. The central bank's Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) will meet again on July 30-31. ""Copom decided in the last meeting that in light of these growing uncertainties — which evidently also unanchor domestic expectations and have affected the price of some assets, such as the exchange rate — they preferred to pause,"" Mello said. ""What I observe is that this set of uncertainties still exists,"" he said, highlighting doubts about when monetary easing will kick off in the U.S. and the possibility of a policy shift in Japan. Since the latest Copom meeting, the Brazilian real has weakened more than 6% from the 5.30 per U.S. dollar that the central bank used in its inflation projections. Market concerns about leftist Lula's commitment to controlling public finances have also weighed on local assets, impacting the exchange rate and interest rate futures. Amid the impasse over a lack of compensation for payroll tax relief passed by Congress, Mello said that the impact of the measure is significant enough to jeopardize the government's goal of eliminating the primary budget deficit this year. However, he said that the ministry continues to support Congress in seeking compensatory measures. ""We would like to balance the budget this year, but we face these difficulties. We have not yet resolved a significant amount of the revenue we were counting on, but we intend to solve this soon,"" he said. ""We will continue to make progress step by step to dispel these uncertainties and create an environment that will eventually allow us to resume the cycle of rate cuts."""
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/explainerthe-fed-nears-its-2-solution-after-a-punishing-bout-of-rising-prices-3540845,"By Howard Schneider WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Inflation is nearing the Federal Reserve's 2% target, and the central bank is expected to begin cutting interest rates as soon as September. While it may take a while for the pace of price increases to fall all the way to 2% - and policymakers will be sensitive to signs inflation is taking off again - the last chapter of the battle appears to be underway. It was a disruptive period. But after a decade when inflation largely ran below the Fed's target, the overall price level in the U.S. economy is now not too far from where it would have been had the central bank hit its inflation goal month-by-month all along. HOW BAD WAS IT? It wasn't the worst bout of inflation the U.S. has experienced. But it was bad and moreover it happened fast, with food prices skyrocketing, home prices stretching the limits of affordability, and an array of services like auto insurance still in the process of resetting higher. The concern wasn't so much the price increase for any given category. Fed officials focus on the overall price level, not the relative cost among goods that rise and fall over time. But when prices for the types of items consumers pay most attention to - gas, food and housing, for example - rise fast it can influence public psychology, and it's the need to control expectations that led the Fed to raise interest rates as fast as it did. WILL PRICES DROP FROM HERE? The bad news for consumers moving forward: Even if price increases have been tamed by and large, higher prices are here to stay. Price level shocks don't reverse, and even overall price drops from one month to the next are rare. Economists would argue that it wouldn't even be healthy if they did, since deflation - a chronic drop in prices - can be even more corrosive to the economy than prices that rise too fast. In fact guarding against deflation, and the falling wages and living standards that go with it, is why the central bank sets an inflation target to begin with. The Fed's mandate from Congress is to keep prices ""stable."" While some have argued that implies no inflation, central banks globally feel a slow, steady rise in prices and wages - 2% is considered the norm for what amounts to background noise in the economy, though that is based more on intuition than formal modeling - keeps both households and businesses looking forward without distorting their decisions. PCE VS CPI The other bad news for consumers is that the Fed's target is set using what is known as the Personal Consumption Expenditures price index, a measure of inflation derived from the national income accounts used to calculate overall economic growth. The Fed feels that the PCE index better reflects the general movement of prices throughout the economy. The more broadly known measure, the Consumer Price Index, is calculated from a representative basket of consumer goods, and there are key differences between PCE and CPI. For example, CPI puts a heavier weight on housing, which comes directly out of a household's budget, and less on medical care, which tends to be covered by health insurance with a complicated cost-sharing structure. By contrast, PCE puts more weight on the actual cost of medical care regardless of whether it is borne by the patient or an insurance company. PCE tends to run a bit lower than CPI, and the gap has widened somewhat during the pandemic. In other words, consumers may still find their bills rising far more than they would like even at the point where the Fed says it's time to ease the brakes on the economy by cutting interest rates. The Fed next meets on July 30-31, when it is expected to hold rates steady."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/analysisus-yield-curve-nears-flip-with-jury-out-on-recession-signal-3540834,"By Davide Barbuscia NEW YORK (Reuters) - The longest and deepest U.S. Treasury yield curve inversion in history, a key bond market signal of an upcoming recession, could be nearing its end. While an inverted curve has typically preceded a recession, this time there is debate about the predictive power of the curve, with optimism that the U.S. could escape prolonged economic pain. Some indicators in recent weeks have pointed to a slowdown, but growth remains strong thanks to a resilient labor market. ""I'm not looking at it as recessionary as of now, I think it's a very different time,"" said Phil Blancato, chief market strategist at Osaic. Investors observe the shape of the Treasury yield curve - which plots the yields of all Treasury securities - because it reveals market expectations on monetary policy and the economy. An inverted yield curve, which occurs when short-term debt yields more than long-term paper, has been a harbinger of a recession in nine out of 10 instances over the last 70 years, according to Deutsche Bank data. Several Wall Street firms expected a recession to occur last year because of higher borrowing costs, but continued economic resilience defied those projections. Economists polled by Reuters this month expect the U.S. economy will keep expanding over the next two years. A majority of bond strategists polled by Reuters earlier this year said the curve was no longer a reliable recession signal. ""It is one of those indicators that may be not as perfect as the data suggests,"" said Lawrence Gillum, chief fixed income strategist for LPL Financial (NASDAQ: ). ""Right now, as the yield curve disinverts it's not because of recession, it's just getting back to a normal upward-sloping yield curve."" A key part of the Treasury yield curve that plots two-year and 10-year yields has been continuously inverted since early July 2022, exceeding a previous inversion record from 1978. The inversion followed a cycle of interest-rate increases by the Federal Reserve that started in March 2022 to tame inflation. In recent weeks, that curve has steepened - meaning that the spread of two-year yields over 10-year (2/10 curve) has narrowed - amid signs of a cooling economy. On Wednesday, the curve hit minus-14.5 basis points, the least inverted it has been since July 2022, Tradeweb data showed. On Friday it was at minus-18.5. The curve typically turns positive because a slowing economy leads to markets anticipating the Fed will cut rates, causing a rally in short-term debt more than in longer-dated bonds. Yields decline when bond prices increase. But while a disinversion could happen amid signs of the economy only moderately slowing, as it appears to be doing now, some analysts warn recent yield curve history suggests an economic contraction could still be in the cards. ""In recent cycles, a re-steepening back out of inversion has occurred shortly before a recession, so that’s one to keep an eye on, given how it’s moved ahead of the past few downturns,"" Deutsche Bank strategist Jim Reid said in a note on Thursday. In every case Deutsche Bank examined, the curve had re-steepened before the recession started. In the past four recessions - 2020, 2007-2009, 2001 and 1990-1991 - the 2/10 curve had turned positive by the time a recession occurred, according to a Deutsche Bank analysis published last year. The interval between a disinversion and the beginning of recession varied, ranging roughly between two and six months in those four instances. “We are at an important point today, because now the yield curve ... is getting steeper, and that's usually when we run into some trouble,” said George Cipolloni, portfolio manager at Penn Mutual Asset Management. Another closely watched part of the curve comparing three-month yields with 10-year yields also disinverted before the last four U.S. recessions started, said Campbell Harvey, a finance professor at Duke University, who pioneered the idea that the yield curve is an indicator of future economic performance. That curve inverted in November 2022 and was still deeply inverted at minus-109 basis points on Friday. The longest interval between an inversion of the three month/10-year yield curve and a recession is 22 months, he has observed. ""It's too early to rule the signal out like a false signal,"" he said."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/citi-lowers-china-2024-gdp-growth-forecast-to-48-93CH-3540832,"Citi revised its 2024 economic growth forecast for China, lowering the expected gross domestic product (GDP) growth rate from 5.0% year-over-year (YoY) to 4.8% YoY. The adjustment comes in response to several factors indicating a slowdown in the country's economic momentum. The bank cited a significant growth miss in the second quarter of 2024, with real GDP growth falling short of expectations at 4.7% YoY. This underperformance, alongside a continuation of incremental support policies, prompted the revision to account for the observed economic weakness. Further softening in economic activity was noted in July, with high-frequency data pointing to a deceleration. In particular, property sales in the top 30 cities saw a contraction of 20.0% YoY in the period from July 1-28, compared to a 19.5% YoY decline in June. Industrial activity also faced challenges due to weather events such as floods and typhoons, which disrupted supply chains and kept production ratios low for materials like asphalt and cement. Citi also highlighted the measured nature of recent policy efforts following the Third Plenum. Despite a new round of policies, they were characterized as reactive and targeted rather than sweeping changes. The bank noted that the pace of rate cuts and fiscal easing did not introduce new stimuli but rather reallocated existing funds, dampening expectations for immediate economic boosts. The current economic environment has not been conducive to a revival of confidence, with consumption and private investment likely to remain subdued. Citi anticipates that stimulus measures may become more prominent in 2025, in anticipation of potential external demand fluctuations and the upcoming US Presidential election. The bank forecasts a potential rise in the headline fiscal deficit to around 3.5% of GDP in 2025 and anticipates cuts in the 7-day Reverse Repo rate the following year, suggesting a growing urgency for policy stimulus if external conditions worsen.

https://www.investing.com/news/economy/central-bank-meetings-apple-corporate-earnings--whats-moving-markets-3540624,"Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures rise at the start of a week that includes several major central bank meetings, including the Federal Reserve, as well as earnings from key tech companies. Apple is taking its time incorporating artificial intelligence features into its key products, while the European corporate results season also continues. 1. Fed leads central bank parade this week The spotlight this week will be on central banks, with the , the and the all set to hold policy meetings. The Fed concludes its July policy meeting on Wednesday, and is widely expected to maintain its benchmark overnight interest rate in the current 5.25%-5.50% range, as it has done since last July. However, markets are overwhelmingly expecting a September rate cut, especially after Friday’s personal consumption expenditures price index, the Fed’s favorite gauge of inflation, showed signs of cooling prices. Thus the statement by Fed Chair will be studied carefully to see if he sets the stage for a rate cut at the next meeting. The Bank of Japan concludes its latest policy setting meeting on Wednesday, and speculation over the prospect of a rate hike is mounting despite a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment. The Bank of England meets on Thursday amid a great deal of uncertainty over whether policymakers will deliver their first rate cut since 2020. Last month, the BoE's Monetary Policy Committee voted 7-2 to keep rates on hold, but this decision is expected to be more finely balanced with policymakers having to judge between higher-than-expected service price inflation and weak growth. 2. Futures rise ahead of Fed meeting, earnings U.S. stock futures edged higher Monday at the start of a week dominated by a Federal Reserve meeting as well as a number of key corporate earnings. By 04:05 ET (08:05 GMT), the contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, higher, climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and rose by 70 points, or 0.4%. The major indices slipped lower last week, with the hit hard, in particular, by the cooling off of the tech trade. Big Tech earnings are set to continue in the coming days, with Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ: ) as well as Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday. Disappointing numbers could reignite the worries that caused a bruising selloff last week, with the Nasdaq suffering its worst day since late 2022 on Wednesday. 3. Apple’s AI plans take time Apple (NASDAQ: ) is taking longer than expected to include its recently unveiled artificial intelligence features, known as Apple Intelligence, into its flagship iPhone and iPad devices, and they will not be included in an initial software update, according to a report by Bloomberg. Apple’s AI plans will miss the initial September releases of iOS 18 and iPadOS 18, the Bloomberg report showed, but should be included with the October updates. The company had in June unveiled a slew of new AI-powered features for its flagship devices, hoping the seemingly insatiable demand for all things AI would help the firm offset steadily slowing sales of its flagship iPhone. Apple is set to report its June quarter earnings later this week, and is expected to log a sustained decline in device sales amid increased competition and saturation in the smartphone market. 4. writes down Chinese investment’s value There are also earnings in Europe to digest, as the second-quarter results season continues. Heineken (AS: ) shares slumped 7% after the world’s second-largest brewer missed half-year estimates and announced a hefty impairment, as it wrote down the value of its 40% stake in China Resources Beer. That said, Heineken also raised its full-year profit guidance, expecting to deliver organic operating profit growth of between 4% and 8% in 2024, compared to its previous guidance of between low and high single-digit growth. Philips (AS: ) stock rose 10% after the Dutch medical device maker reported second-quarter results that beat expectations, boosted by higher earnings, the implementation of its restructuring program and insurance income linked to its Respironics product liability claims. (LON: ) stock fell 3.5% after the educational publisher posted a drop in pretax profit compared with a year earlier, even as the company said it is on track to meet full-year expectations. 5. Crude gains on raised Middle East tensions Crude prices rose Monday on concerns of a widening conflict in the Middle East, potentially impacting global supply, after a deadly rocket strike in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. By 04:05 ET, the futures (WTI) climbed 0.1% to $77.20 a barrel, while the contract rose 0.1% to $80.38 a barrel. The weekend’s strike reportedly killed at least 12 people, and has been blamed by both Israel and the U.S. on Iran-backed Hezbollah, who have denied responsibility for the attack. Israel has vowed retaliation against Hezbollah in Lebanon, and Israeli jets hit targets in southern Lebanon on Sunday. These increasing tensions are also seen diminishing the prospect of a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas, as hopes of a ceasefire in Gaza had been gaining momentum. Still, gains are limited as the outlook for crude demand remains bleak."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy/goldman-sachs-fed-to-indicate-september-rate-cut-more-likely-3540617,"Recent comments from Federal Reserve officials signal they will likely remain on hold at their upcoming meeting, but the prospect of a first interest rate cut has become more probable, according to Goldman Sachs economists. The primary factor moving the FOMC closer to a cut is the favorable inflation data from May and June. After firmer inflation figures in Q1—attributed largely to residual seasonality and typical month-to-month noise—Q2 saw significant improvement in inflation news. Goldman Sachs economists expect the July inflation data to be favorable as well, as catch-up inflation is diminishing. The spike in the January OER should see a payback due to a six-month rotation in the sample of rental units, and residual seasonality in PCE inflation numbers is anticipated to turn negative again. Another reason for the shift in Fed officials' tone is the rise in the unemployment rate, which has increased by 0.1 percentage points for the past three months, reaching 4.1%. This represents a 0.7 percentage point increase from its lowest point, or nearly 0.5 percentage points on a three-month average basis. ""For now, the labor market is in a good place,” Goldman economists noted. “It is roughly as tight as before the pandemic, a period that struck a very favorable balance between full employment and near-target inflation.” However, slack in the labor market has been increasing, and job growth has been declining. Chair Powell has mentioned several times in the past month that further softening in the labor market would be undesirable. Nonetheless, economists expect the labor market to stabilize naturally in its current state, given the solid final demand growth indicated by the Q2 GDP report, which should support labor demand growth as well. Still, cutting rates “sooner rather than later could help to ensure that outcome,"" Goldman’s team added. ""We expect these recent trends in the data will lead the FOMC to revise its statement at next week’s meeting in ways that will hint that a cut at the following meeting in September has become more likely.” The Wall Street bank suspects that an acceptable July CPI report could clinch a September cut. Fed leadership appears close to being convinced, and leaving the decision until the final August data could make the decision too reliant on one last CPI report. Beyond September, the June projections suggest most FOMC participants expect the cuts to occur once per quarter as inflation continues to return to the 2% target, aligning with Goldman Sachs' baseline forecast. In the near term, economists said the main risk is that the FOMC might cut more quickly, possibly at consecutive meetings, if labor market data soften more than expected and the motivation shifts from normalization to actively countering an economic slowdown."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/take-five-scores-on-the-doors-for-big-tech-3540534,"(Reuters) -It's a big week for central banks, with policymakers in the United States, Japan and Britain all due to reconsider lending rates and markets on edge over more earnings from U.S. tech giants. In Venezuela, voters went to the polls to elect a president. Here's your look at what's happening in markets in the coming week, from Kevin Buckland in Tokyo, Ira Iosebashvili and Rodrigo Campos in New York and Amanda Cooper in London. 1/SEPTEMBER QUESTION The steep selloff in markets in recent days is shining a spotlight on the Federal Reserve, which concludes its July monetary policy meeting on Wednesday. Signs of economic concern from the Fed could give investors - already unnerved by turbulence in U.S. tech stocks - yet another reason to worry. As it is, investors believe the time to ease monetary policy is swiftly approaching: futures tied to the Fed funds rate show investors pricing in a more than 90% chance of a September rate cut amid evidence of cooling inflation and a nascent downshift in the jobs market. U.S. employment data due Aug. 2 will give investors the opportunity to assess whether the gradual signs of slowing that bolstered rate cut expectations have continued in July. Economists polled by Reuters expect the U.S. to have created 185,000 jobs in July, compared with 206,000 in the prior month. 2/TECH TANTRUMS Spooked investors also face a minefield of Big Tech earnings, with misses threatening to further upend a market roiled by worries over stretched stock valuations. Microsoft (NASDAQ: ) is scheduled to report earnings on Tuesday, followed by Facebook-parent Meta (NASDAQ: ) on Wednesday and Apple (NASDAQ: ) and Amazon (NASDAQ: ) on Thursday. Disappointing numbers could re-ignite the worries that caused a crushing selloff in U.S. stocks on Wednesday, when both the and Nasdaq suffered their worst day since late 2022. The huge run-up in tech stocks may have set a high bar for their results. Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: ), whose earnings were one of the triggers for the recent selloff, actually reported better-than-expected revenue, but investors grew wary that rising spending on AI infrastructure could squeeze margins, sending the shares 5% lower. 3/HIKES AND SPIKES Speculation is growing that the Bank of Japan could hike rates on Wednesday after high-profile politicians - including the prime minister - hinted at the need for near-term policy normalisation. It's not the need to end decades of extraordinary stimulus, per se, that is at the heart of their arguments. Rather, the weak yen's choking effect on households and businesses that looks to be turning the exchange rate into a central issue for the ruling Liberal Democratic Party's leadership convention in September. The fact that the currency has rebounded by a staggering 10 yen per dollar from three-decade lows at the start of the month hasn't deterred some from predicting a July hike. They argue the BOJ can get the most bang for its buck by hiking into a rallying yen. Others worry a fragile economy and weak consumer sentiment couldn't weather higher borrowing costs, with slowing U.S. growth set to have a knock-on effect already. 4/STICKY ISSUES The Bank of England meets on Thursday and right now, markets see a roughly 48% chance that rates will fall for the first time since March 2020. Growth is modest and consumer inflation has returned to 2%. Yet wage growth and service-sector inflation are proving sticky and running hotter than a number of policy-setters at the Old Lady of Threadneedle Street, as the Bank of England is known, would like. Clare Lombardelli, the new deputy governor, may hold the deciding vote, as the other eight Monetary Policy Committee members are split evenly on whether to hold or cut. British consumers might be feeling the pinch of interest rates at more than 14-year highs, but banks have certainly reaped the benefits. Markets will watch results from HSBC, Barclays and Standard Chartered (OTC: ) to get a sense of how well they are likely to fare when borrowing costs, and the profit they make on them, start to fall. 5/A MULTI-BILLION QUESTION Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro and his opposition rival Edmundo Gonzalez each claimed victory in a presidential election on Monday morning, after a vote marked by accusations of underhand tactics and isolated incidents of violence. The electoral authority said just after midnight on Monday that Maduro had won a third term with 51% of the vote, despite multiple exit polls pointing to an opposition win. The authority said opposition candidate Gonzalez won 44% of the vote, though the opposition had earlier said it had ""reasons to celebrate"" and asked supporters to continue monitoring vote counts. Venezuela had suffered six-digit hyperinflation for about four years, with the indicator reaching a heady 130,000%, eroding savings and making basic supplies scarce. But annual inflation fell to around 50% over the last year as the government restricted credit, held the exchange rate steady and curbed public spending. The results and handling of the vote are one half of the puzzle determining future U.S. sanctions on Venezuela - the battle for the White House is, of course, yet to come in November. Current curbs include a ban on buying bonds directly from Venezuela's government. That precludes, for now, a restructuring of some $60 billion in international bonds owed by the government and state-owned oil firm PDVSA. Venezuela's and PDVSA'S defaulted bonds trade at deeply distressed levels of 13-22 cents, but have rallied sharply from late last year's single-digits. Investors are watching Maduro's handling of the election very closely."
https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/japan-to-achieve-primary-budget-surplus-next-year-govt-estimate-shows-3540515,"By Leika Kihara TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan will achieve a goal of running a primary budget surplus next year for the first time since it was introduced in 2002, a government estimate showed on Monday, as improvements in the economy and robust corporate profits boost tax revenues. The achievement will help Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's administration argue that Japan is making progress in fixing the country's tattered finances, analysts say. Japan will achieve a primary budget surplus of 0.8 billion yen ($5.2 million) in fiscal 2025, which means tax revenues will slightly exceed expenditures, according to a revised estimate presented to a meeting of the government's top economic council. The revision compared with an estimate made in January that showed Japan would run a primary budget deficit of 1.1 trillion yen. The primary budget balance, which excludes new bond sales and debt-servicing costs, is a key gauge of how much policy measures can be financed without issuing debt. Japan's primary budget balance has been in deficit for most of the postwar era with the exception of the asset bubble period between 1986 and 1991, resulting in a huge debt-pile that is twice the size of its economy. In annual economic and fiscal policy guidelines set in June, the government affirmed a pledge to deliver a primary budget surplus by next fiscal year. Achieving a primary budget surplus has become particularly important as the Bank of Japan is seen raising interest rates from current near-zero levels, which would boost the cost of funding Japan's huge public debt.
